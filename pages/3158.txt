'''Santa Brigida di Svezia '''is a later 20th century parish church at Via Luzzana 13, in the south of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottavia_(zona_di_Roma) Ottavia] suburban zone and just east of the Circonvallazione Settentrionale. The locality is called [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmarola_(Roma) Palmarola].

The dedication is to St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_of_Sweden Bridget of Sweden].
==History==
This is one of three neighbouring parishes in Ottavia without proper churches, but which worship instead in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storefront_church storefront churches] in the ground floors of apartment blocks. The arrangement looks as if the Diocese tried an experiment  at Ottavia along the lines of how to evangelize the suburbs cheaply. 

This particular parish was established in 1983, and entrusted to the administration of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit (''Spiritani''). They used to be called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Ghost_Fathers Holy Ghost Fathers] in English-speaking countries, but prefer the name ''Spiritans''.

The experiment is now regarded with disfavour. These three parishes may be replaced by a single one with a genuine purpose-built church some time in the future, although there are no firm plans yet (2016). See [[Sant’Ilario di Poitiers]] and [[San Massimo Vescovo a Palmarola]].
==Appearance==

There no architecturally distinct church building. Instead, the parish took over the ground floor of a two-storey apartment building, rendered in puce, and uses that.

A small marble statue of the Sacred Hearth in the tiny garden area between the edifice and the street advertises it as a place of worship.

The interior is small and cramped, with walls and ceiling painted in white and a row of thin pillars supporting the roof down the left hand side. The right hand wall is the street frontage, and has domestic-style rectangular windows with poor-quality semi-abstract stained glass.

There is nothing of architectural or artistic interest here at all.

== Parish offices ==
The parish has the very unsatisfactory situation that its offices are spread over three sites away from the church:
* The priests live in the ''Casa dei Sacerdoti ''at Via Treviglio 7.
* The parish office at the ''Vecchio oratorio ''is at Via Della Palmarola 145-9
* The parish office at the ''Nouvo oratorio ''is at Via Gorlago 4/16
The two offices open on different days at different times, in a confusing way. See the parish website.

== Liturgy ==

=== Church ===
Mass is celebrated:

Mondays 8:30, Wednesdays to Fridays 17:30 (18:30 in summer), Saturdays 8:30, 17:30; 

Sundays and Solemnities 8:00, 10:00, 11:30.

On Thursdays there is Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament from 17:00 to 20:00, which combines with the evening Mass. On other days, the Rosary is recited half an hour before the evening Mass.

=== Subsidiary Mass centres ===
There have been two subsidiary Mass centres operated by the parish:

[[Santa Maria della Provvidenza alla Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi]]

[[Santa Maria del Servizio alla Borgata del Podere Buccari]]

The latter chapel, however, is not now advertised on the parish website and so may be closed.
