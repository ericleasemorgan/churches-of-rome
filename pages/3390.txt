'''Santa Maria della Concezione delle Viperesche '''is the 17th century church of a former convent of oblate nuns on the north side of Via San Vito, west of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Gallienus Arch of Gallienus] and very near [[Santi Vito e Modesto]] in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquilino_(rione_di_Roma) rione Esquilino].

It is dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her title of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception Immaculate Conception].
==History==

The convent had been established by one Livia Vipereschi in 1668, hence the strange name. It was attached to a college for poor girls and orphans, which survived the suppression of convents in the city in 1873 but was closed in the late 20th century.

The foundation was originally for a female lay confraternity, but this quickly became a new sisterhood of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelites Carmelite] Oblate Tertiaries.

The premises are now occupied by a new female religious society known as the ''Pie Discepole del Redentore, ''which runs the premises as a university hostel.
==Appearance==
This church is very small, on a simple rectangular plan. It forms part of the main convent building.

There is a small rectangular façade framed by two thin square Doric pilasters supporting a protruding architrave. There was a vertical rectangular window either side of the door, and a horizontal one above. Between this and the door lintel was an oval tondo containing a representation of Our Lady. The façade survives, although the picture does not. The ''Pie Discepole'' have placed a modern ceramic depiction of the Immaculate Conception in the tondo as a replacement, and this has the date 1909.

A 19th century depiction of the Immaculate Conception survives as the altarpiece.
