'''Santa Maria Regina dei Cuori '''is an early 20th century convent church at Via Romagna 44 in the rione [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovisi_(rione_di_Roma) Ludovisi], just south of the Corso d’Italia.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "Queen of Hearts".
==History==

This is the convent church for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Mary Company of Mary], otherwise known as the Montfort Fathers, who were founded by St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Montfort Louis Grignion de Montfort] and whose Generalate is adjacent.

It was designed for them by [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Passarelli Tullio Passarelli], and completed in 1913.
==Exterior==

This is a small single-aisled building, with a pitched roof and a semi-circular external apse. The fabric is in an eclectic style, using puce-coloured brick and travertine limestone for the details. 

The façade is dominated by a huge arch sunk into the brickwork. This contains the entrance porch, which has two detached round columns in stone supporting a small arch enclosing the tympanum. There is a gabled top to the porch. Above it, within the arch, is a pair of round-headed lancet windows separated by a thin column with capital matching the porch ones in style. The roofline is dentillated all round the church, with little stone cornices to match.

The tympanum has a mosaic of the Annunciation. The capitals of the porch columns are superbly carved to represent groups of demons, and are very enjoyable. The church is worth visiting for these alone.
==Interior==

Inside, the stained glass is good, and there is a noteworthy marble sculpture of the Madonna and Child with St Louis de Montfort and St Gabriel by Paolo Bartolini.

The carved choir stalls are by Francesco Milizia.
==Liturgy==
According to the Diocese (July 2018), Mass on weekdays is at 7:30, and on Sundays at 8:30.
