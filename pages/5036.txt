'''Madonna del Rosario a Casetta Mattei '''is a later 20th century public chapel located at Via dei Malabaila 1 in the north of the suburb area of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corviale_(zona_di_Roma) Corviale]. This is part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianicolense_(suburbio_di_Roma) Gianicolense suburban] zone, and the actual area is called ''Casetta Mattei''.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her aspect of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_the_Rosary Our Lady of the Rosary].

== History ==
The locality is a very odd clutch of six late 20th century apartment blocks, in an isolated location surrounded by green fields and with only one road in or out -the Via dei Chiaramonti.

The chapel is a pastoral outlet of the parish of [[Nativit√† di Maria a Bravetta]], which is doing the inhabitants a favour since it is a long walk to the nearest bus stop and the little neighbourhood has no social facilities.

== Appearance ==
The chapel is in the basement of an apartment block, and has no distinguishing features. Inside, it is an L-shaped flat-roofed room in white with the altar in the angle. A semi-abstract altarpiece featuring two sheep and a basket of loaves gives a welcome splash of colour, as it is mostly in green with the loaves in vermillion orange.

== Liturgy ==
According to the parish website (June 2018), a Mass is celebrated here on Sundays and Solemnities at 9:00.
