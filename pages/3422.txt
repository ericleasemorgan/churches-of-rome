'''Santa Maria Goretti a Casal Lumbroso '''is a 21st century parish church at Via Tommaso Mosca 17, in the suburb of Casal Lumbroso west of junction 33 of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Raccordo_Anulare Grande Raccordo Anulare] (Circonvallazione Orientale).

== History ==
The parish was founded in 2006. It has been promised a permanent church, but nothing has happened twelve years on.

It was originally entrusted to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogationists Rogationists], but they had to give it up in 2012.

== Appearance ==
The church is basically a large hut made out of concrete blocks and with a pitched concrete slab roof, below the level of the street and accessed by a sloping drive. This structure joins onto a two-storey priest's house at the back

There is a campanile of sorts, being two vertical steel bars joined at the top to form a triangle from which a single bell hangs.

== Liturgy ==
Mass on Sundays and Solemnities is at 10:00, according to the Diocese in June 2018 (there is no information readily available on weekday Masses).

The parish does actually have the use of a permanent church building, [[Santa Maria Nuova a Casal Lumbroso]], but this is owned by the adjacent college and has no ancillary accommodation.
