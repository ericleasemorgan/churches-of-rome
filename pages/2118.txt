'''Santa Rita da Cascia''' is a deconsecrated church dedicated to St Rita of Cascia, an Augustinian nun who lived from [[1377]] until [[1447]]. Pictures of the church at Wikimedia Commons.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Santa_Rita_da_Cascia_Church_%28Rovigo%29] It is situated on the junction between V. Montanara and V. del Teatro Marcellino, and should not be confused with the church of S. Maria delle Vergine near the Trevi Fountain which is also dedicated to this saint.
==History==

The first church was built in the 11th century on what is now the Piazza Aracoeli, and was called ''San Biagio in Mercatello/Campitello''. In 1900 St Rita was canonized, and the church was rededicated to her.

In [[1928]], the original church was demolished as part of Mussolini's remodelling of Rome. The little belltower and an ancient apse fresco survive on site, the latter protected by a small roof. The rest of the church was reconstructed on its new site in [[1937]], using original stonework. It has since been deconsecrated, and is now used for exhibitions. Paradoxically, this means that access is easier than with many small Roman churches, and is usually without charge.

==Exterior==

The fa√ßade, reconstructed in 1937, was designed by [[Carlo Fontana]] in [[1665]]. It features four Corinthian pilasters framing a triple-arched entrance with an oeil-de-boeuf window over the central door.



==Interior==

The interior is octagonal in form. All paintings and statues have been removed, but the Baroque altar and tabernacle, featuring inlaid coloured marbles, are in situ and can be examined.
