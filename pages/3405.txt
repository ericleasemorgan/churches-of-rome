It is in a rural district, on the road to Bracciano and south-west of the town of Cesano. Pictures of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [[commons:File:S._Andrea_apostolo_(Osteria_Nuova_-_Rome)_04.JPG|here]].

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_the_Apostle Andrew the Apostle].

This church is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina].

== History ==
Osteria Nuova is basically a rather scrappily laid-out suburb in the middle of open countryside, which grew up around a wayside hostelry in the mid 20th century. The original church for the locality was [[Santa Maria in Celsano]], but this is an inconvenient distance to the south. A tiny chapel attached to a farmstead was provided in the 18th century, but this was much too small -see [[Cappella del Casale dell'Osteria Nuova]].

So, a new church was provided next to a sports field in the village. The old one kept on, but the chapel was abandoned.

The dedication recalls that of [[Sant'Andrea a Galeria Antica]], formerly the parish church for the locality but in ruins since the early 19th century.

== Appearance ==
The church is located off a dead-end street towards the west end of the village, and is not easy to find.

This is a completely unpretentious little brick building, with a pitched roof and a single entrance in the gable end. The brownish-red bricks are laid alternately normal and oversized, which gives a horizontally striped effect. There are three rectangular windows in each side.

The doorway is surrounded by a stone arch and has a tiled entrance canopy supported by brick pillars occupying the whole width of the frontage. This continues down the side of the adjacent priest’s house (which is much bigger than the church). 

There is a sculpture adjacent, made of six vertical square wooden beams joined by crosspieces and with the longest beam bearing a thin cross of iron rods.

The interior is equally simple, having a rectangular plan and whitewashed walls. The roof is open but is boarded and whitewashed as well, although the roof trusses and tie-beams are in varnished wood.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated:

Weekdays 17:00 (18:00 in Daylight Saving Time);

Sundays and Solemnities 11:00.

Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament takes place on Thursdays between 18:30 and 19:00.

On the third Wednesday of the month, Mass is celebrated at the ''Cimitero Santa Maria di Galeria ''at 15:00 (16:00 in Daylight Saving Time).

The old church of [[Santa Maria in Celsano]] is only open on Sundays.
