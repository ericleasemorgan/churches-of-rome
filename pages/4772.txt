'''Santa Maria Immacolata delle Piccole Sorelle dei Poveri''' is a convent chapel of the Roman headquarters of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor Little Sisters of the Poor] at Piazza di San Pietro in Vincoli 6 in the rione Monti.

==History==
The Little Sisters of the Poor is an international congregation which was founded in France by St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Jugan Jeanne Jugan]. They began to build their convent at Rome immediately after obtaining Papal approval in [[1879]], and it was completed in [[1883]] to the design of [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Carimini Luca Carimini].

The site chosen was previously occupied by the garden of the convent of [[Sant'Antonio Abate dei Maroniti]], which has led to the two convents being confused. This one is on the south side of the piazza, and the Maronites are on the west side.
==Description==
This is a private convent chapel, and hence is not accessible to visitors. However, despite being part of a large and impressive edifice it has its own architectural identity. It is a familiar landmark on the Via Eudossiana, projecting from the second storey of the main convent building and looking over the boundary wall. It is a small rectangular structure in red brick with a pentagonal apse. There are three round-headed windows on each side with simple molded frames in white, and these are matched by the projecting roofline cornice also in white. The gable end has a pediment, with a small oculus in the tympanum.

The main entrance of the convent, on the piazza, is actually older than the edifice and was the gateway of the Maronites' garden. It has a rusticated arch with a horizontal cornice over.
