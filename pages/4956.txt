'''San Giuseppe a Tor de’ Cenci '''is a 20th century convent and public chapel located at Via Santi Savarino 50. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_de%27_Cenci Tor de' Cenci] suburban zone.

The convent is named after St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph Joseph], but the Diocese seems to regard the dedication as informal.

== History ==
The convent was founded by the ''[http://www.doroteefrassinetti.org/TextPage/UI/Text.aspx?page=2530 Suore Maestre di Santa Dorotea di Santa Paola Frassinetti]'' in Tor de’ Cenci, which is the southern limit of the suburban built-up area on the Via Pontina. The buildings look late Sixties, and apparently housed a school.
The importance of this chapel lies in the fact that it was the first Mass centre in the developing suburb. The parish church was some distance away, being the present [[Sant’Andrea Apostolo in Castel di Decima]].

However, in 1995 the new parish church of [[Gesù Divin Salvatore]] was built fairly close by. The chapel is still a public Mass centre for the time being, but it remains to be seen if this continues.

The school was closed down some years ago, and the Diocese lists only one sister permanently resident here.

== Appearance ==
Look for a gateway with a pair of stone pineapple finials. The latter is the only architectural item of interest -the complex is very boring modernist architecture. The chapel has no separate identity.

== Liturgy ==
According to the Diocese (May 2018), Mass is celebrated here at 7:30 on weekdays and 8:00 on Sundays and Solemnities.[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
