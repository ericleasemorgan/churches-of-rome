'''SS Nome di Maria a Via Latina''' is a modern parish church at Via Centirupe 18/22 in the Appio Latino quarter, just to the east of the Parco della Caffarella.

==Exterior==

It was built in 1980, to an unusual and intriguing modernist design by [[Aldo Ortolani]]. The plan is based on a square with the major axis on the diagonal and the corners of the square at the entrance and behind the altar truncated. From entrance to altar there is a high rectangular concrete frame, supporting a flat roof. Either side of this the building descends in four horizontal steps, each step supporting a vertical concrete vane, and these steps are replicated vertically along the side frontages. At the side angles of the square are two semi-circular chapels, one dedicated to St Anthony of Padua and the other to Our Lady of the Pillar (a Spanish devotion).

The entrance façade and the external altar wall are just concrete slabs, and all the rest of the structure is bare concrete. There is a floating canopy over the entrance, which slopes down in an inward curve. On its fascia is a dedicatory inscription. The entrance doors themselves are carved wood planking, and are themselves set in varnished planking which fills the frontage below the canopy. At the top of the entrance façade is a horizontal window strip, and vertical window strips edge each of the vertical steps along the side frontages. Another horizontal window strip is at the top of the altar wall.

There is a tall campanile, formed simply of two narrow concrete slabs in the form of an L. The bells are hung in the angle. There is a metal cross on the top.

==Interior==

Like the exterior, the interior is entirely exposed grey concrete. This might sound grim, but the vast single space is redeemed by the quality of the abstract stained glass in the horizontal and vertical window strips, the colours of which are dominated by azure blue. Behind the altar is a semicircular coved concrete walls, surrounded by vertical and horizontal window strips which are mostly magenta instead. Above this is the main altar wall, which has an upward and outward sweep of raw concrete on which is a figure of Christ crucified without a cross. The two chapes are much more intimate spaces, and here the glass is also blue.
