'''San Filippo Neri all’Acquedotto Felice '''is a 20th century convent church with a postal address at Via dell’Acquedotto Felice 35 off the Via Tuscolana, in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscolano Tuscolano] quarter, west of the Porta Furba Quadraro metro station and by the main line railway.

The church faces the Vicolo dell'Acquedotto Felice, the next street to the west.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Neri Philip Neri].
==History==

This is the church of a convent of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figlie_dell'Oratorio Daughters of the Oratory] (''Figlie dell'Oratorio''), who run a school there. The edifice looks mid 20th century.

The convent now includes a hotel, the Casa [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Grossi Vincenzo Grossi] named after the congregation's founder. 
==Appearance==
The church has a single nave, with a gabled and tiled roof and an external apse with straight sides and a shallowly curved back wall.

The façade is very simple, being just a dull pink rendered gabled wall. The entrance door is within a white molded archway, and has a porch added which is a flat concrete slab wider than the archway and set on two concrete pillars. The archivolt of the arch is above the porch and so shows a tympanum, but this is undecorated.

In the centre of the façade is a small round-headed window. That is all.
