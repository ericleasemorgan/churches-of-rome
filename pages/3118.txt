'''Sant'Agostina Pietrantoni della Borgatella''' is a 21st century parish church off Via Casal Tidei in the north-west part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Basilio_(quartiere_di_Roma) San Basilio] district, between the Via Tiburtina and Via Nomentana. There is no postal address.

The dedication is to St [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostina_Pietrantoni Agostina Pietrantoni.] She was a Sister of Charity from Tivoli, who was a nurse in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ospedale_di_Santo_Spirito_in_Sassia Santo Spirito] hospital at Rome. She was stabbed to death by an anti-clerical patient in 1894.

== History ==
The parish was set up in 1999, and put into the care of the [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregazione_di_Ges%C3%B9_Sacerdote Congregazione di Ges√π Sacerdote]. In practice they combined the administration with that of the parish of [[San Cleto]] nearby, for which they are also responsible. 

The parish initially worshipped in a converted garage, but could not afford the rent and had to use a tent in a public park for a while.

The church was built in 2001, but is still a temporary structure awaiting a permanent replacement. The area is still being developed as a suburb.

In 2018, the Diocese separated the administration from that of ''San Cleto ''and appointed a resident parish priest.

== Appearance ==
Visitors will find the church at the other end of a very large car park between two apartment blocks on the north side of the street.

This is a simple little rectangular building, without any architectural pretensions or interest. The roof is pitched, the walls are painted in light tan and there is a wooden porch.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated;

Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays 19:00;

Sundays and Solemnities 9:00, 10:00 (not summer).
