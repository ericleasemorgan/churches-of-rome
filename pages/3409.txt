The dedication was to Jesus Christ in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Sacrament Blessed Sacrament].

== History ==
Ponte Galeria was a rural settlement in its own right, in the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina], before the local area was incorporated into the city of Rome.

The little church was built in the 17th century by the noble [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serlupi Serlupi] family for their tenants hereabouts, hence a familiar nickname of ''Chiesuola Serlupi''.

A new church was built for the parish of [[Santa Maria Madre della Divina Grazia|Santa Maria Madre della Divina Grazia a Ponte Galeria]] at the end of the 20th century, and as a result the old edifice became redundant and was deconsecrated. 

== Appearance ==
This is a tiny, simple rectangular edifice attached to a farm. The entrance has a fine marble doorcase, and above it is a round window.
