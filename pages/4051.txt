'''Cappella a Via Pietro Ottoboni''' is a small deconsecrated chapel at Via Pietro Ottoboni 9, just south of the Via Tibutina and east of the Tiburtina train station. It is north of [[San Giuseppe Artigiano a Via Tiburtina]].

It is part of a low, flat-roofed building rendered in a faded beige, and is marked by a triangular pediment attached to the roofline. Below this is a wide doorway surmounted by a recessed horizontal rectangular window. This must have been a public chapel, as an empty bellcote with a space for one bell in its arch is to the right of the pediment.

There is no information available online on this edifice.
