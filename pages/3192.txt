'''Sacra Famiglia di Nazareth all’Esquilino '''is a 19th century convent chapel at Via Machiavelli 18, in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquilino_(rione_of_Rome) rione Esquilino] east of Via Merulana. Picture of the church on Wikimedia Commons [[commons:File:Esquilino_-_Sacra_Famiglia_di_Nazareth.JPG|here]].

The dedication is to the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
==History==

It is the convent chapel of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_the_Holy_Family_of_Nazareth Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth], which was founded in 1875 at Rome by a Polish expatriate called Blessed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciszka_Siedliska Maria Siedliska]. She intended it to serve Polish expatriates, but it later had a ministry in independent Poland after 1920 and several sisters were martyred in the Second World War.

The congregation is now worldwide, but remains based at Rome and this convent is the provincial headquarters. The Generalate is now a modern building at Via Nazareth 400, off the Via di Boccea, which was built in 1963. See [[Cappella delle Suore della Sacra Famiglia di Nazareth]].

The convent was begun in [[1884]], the architect being Grazioli, and finished three years later.
==Appearance==

The chapel has no independent architectural identity. However, the main entrance doorway to the convent is distinctive. The doorcase has an arch over a transom window, and above the arch is an entablature with a projecting cornice. Four rosettes decorated the doorcase, and above the cornice is a lunette (slightly more than semi-circular) containing a relief of the Holy Family. The rest of the building is typical Roman civic architecture of c1900.

The altarpiece over the main altar is by Cazottes.

This chapel is near [[Sant’Elena all’Esquilino]], in the same street.
