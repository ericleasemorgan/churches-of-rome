'''Sacro Cuore di Ges√π ai Millevani '''is a 20th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros]] , and is located at Via Carlo Della Rocca 77 which is south of the Via Casilina and near the San Marcellino metro station. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscolano Tuscolano] quarter.

The dedication is to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart Sacred Heart].

== History ==
The premises were allegedly once used by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_Charity_of_Saint_Vincent_de_Paul Daughters of Charity] as a hospital, but the chapel was taken over by the parish in 1968.

The location is fairly near to the parish church, and the future of the chapel must be uncertain.

== Appearance ==
The chapel is in a six-storey apartment block, shabbily rendered and very ugly. The doorway has a little majolica relief roundel of the Sacred Heart above the lintel.[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
