'''San Gioacchino in Prati'''  is a late 19th century parish and titular church, which has its postal address at Piazza dei Quiriti 17 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prati_(rione_di_Roma) rione Prati]. The main entrance is on Via Pompeio Magno just to the east. The Lepanto metro station is close by. Pictures of the church at Wikimedia Commons are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:San_Gioacchino_in_Prati?uselang=it here].

Despite its high prestige ("''chiesa pontificia''") and magnificent architecture, this is not a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_basilica minor basilica].

The dedication is to St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim Joachim], the father of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_(Roman_Catholic) Blessed Virgin Mary].

==History==

=== Project ===
Until the later 19th century, the rione Prati was mostly meadows (hence the name), but after the annexation of Rome by Italy in 1870 it was quickly developed into a closely-packed suburb. To provide for this three parish churches were to be built, which were ''San Gioacchino'', [[Santa Maria del Rosario in Prati]] and [[Sacro Cuore del Suffragio]] -all important buildings. 

The original impetus for building ''San Gioacchino ''came from a French priest of Lyons called Antoine Brugidou. He wished to found an international pious sodality for the purpose of reparative adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, in order to make amends for acts of profanation in France and other countries during the French Revolution and afterwards. This ''Opera Internazionale dell'Adorazione Riparatrice ''was to have its headquarters in Rome at a new church in Prati, paid for by the faithful of various countries. (Not to be confused with ''Soeurs de l'Adoration R''é''paratrice'', a congregation of contemplative nuns.)

The church was to be dedicated to St Joachim, in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the ordination to the priesthood of Pope [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII Leo XIII] in 1887 (the pope's secular name was Gioacchino Pecci). Abbé Brugidou wrote a book about his proposed institute in that year, and in 1890 obtained permission to begin the building project. The pope imposed a maximum limit for the amount of money to be spent, and requested that the church be finished in 1893.

=== Construction ===
The edifice was designed and built by the architect [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/raffaele-ingami_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Raffaele Ingami] (1838-1908) of the ''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabbrica_di_San_Pietro Fabbrica]'' of St Peter's, who also worked on [[Santa Brigida delle Suore Brigidine]]. He was assisted by Lorenzo De Rossi. Construction began on 1 October, 1891, and the crypt was finished in 1892.  

Unfortunately, the Abbé Brugidou proved an incompetent project manager. He seemed to have relied upon [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence Divine Providence] to take care of financial matters -a surprisingly common occurrence at that time, when the Church was setting up many new institutions (although only a few genuine saints got away with such insouciance). As a result, the costs spiralled completely out of control and the completion date was seriously delayed. An inundation of the Tiber in 1896 caused serious damage by flooding out the newly completed crypt. 

Very unfortunately, the Abbé resorted to raising funds by inviting [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=34776 Mass intentions] which he had no likelihood of fulfilling. He had accumulated the astounding total of 260 000 when the pope relieved him of responsibility for the project, after the scandal had become public in 1897. The pope then told him to leave Rome and return to Lyons, with the result that his proposed ''Opera ''faded away. 

The building of the church had to be continued despite the budgetary over-run (abandonment would have been a worse scandal), and it finally opened to the public on August 20, 1898. However, the interior decoration was incomplete especially as regards the side chapels. An idea of the Abbé was followed through, in that Catholics from specific countries around the world  were invited to contribute to the project in honour of the pope. Those countries forwarding major contributions were to have their own chapels. The idea worked, so the construction debts were cleared fairly quickly and the church was fit to be consecrated on 6 June, 1911 by Cardinal [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Respighi Pietro Respighi].

The plan for a detached tower campanile, to the right of the church, had to be abandoned. A sort of little hut containing the bells was provided by Carlo Maria Busiri Vici in 1903, on top of the near end of the left hand side aisle. This had to be removed at some stage, and replaced by an ugly open iron framework at the end of the same aisle.

=== Parish and titular church ===
The parish has been administered by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Most_Holy_Redeemer Redemptorist] order since 1905, when it was given charge of the church. By then, it was obvious that the ''Adorazione Riparatrice ''scheme was dead.

The interior decoration of the side chapels was only completed in 1940, with contributions from the faithful of twenty-four countries. The Redemptorists oversaw the installation of the stained glass windows, obtained from the Bavarian firm of Zettler.

The church was made titular in 1960, with the title of ''San Gioacchino ai Prati di Castello''. It is often referred to by this name in modern publications. The present cardinal priest is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopoldo_Brenes Leopoldo José Brenes Solórzano].

==Exterior==

=== Layout and fabric ===
This is a large basilical church, on the plan of a Latin cross inserted into a rectangle with very short, wide projections enclosing the arms of the cross. The external fabric is in carefully laid stone ashlar blocks (unless these are revetting slabs with brickwork behind). The style could be described as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture neo-Classical], but it is hardly "correct" according to Classical architectural canons and there are Gothic hints. So info.roma calls the architectural style of this church ''elettico, ''rather than neo-Baroque.

The Latin cross consists of a central nave of five bays, a transept with a dome over the crossing and a sanctuary of one bay with a semi-circular apse. The nave has side aisles with galleries over them, so their roofs are as high as the side rooflines of the central nave. At the same level are two half-domes at the ends of the transept. Flanking the sanctuary and behind it are sacristies and priests' accommodation, with the latter having a frontage on the Via degli Scipione behind the church. 

The two-storey entrance [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narthex narthex] or loggia is a separate architectural element, attached to the full width of the nave.

The roofs of the central nave, sanctuary and transept are pitched and tiled, with decorative fleur-de-lys finial tiles on the central ridge of the nave roof and along the rooflines. The gable ends of the central nave and transepts have triangular pediments, with quatrefoil windows in the tympani. These have little rays in the angles between the lobes, a Gothic feature. 

The narthex or loggia has a separate flat roof, while the wide side aisles (including the chapels) share a flat roof with the sacristy and presbyterate accommodation enclosing the sanctuary. The side aisle rooflines have parapets of metal railings separated by stone piers, and these run round the back over the roofline of the presbytery -there is a tight squeeze between the transept half-domes and the parapet for anyone walking around up there. Flanking the apse is a pair of little hemispherical cupolas which top internal spiral staircases.

The nave side walls are two-storey, because of the galleries over the side aisles. The first storey has a row of round windows in dished frames, each of which lights a side chapel. Above, the galleries each have a row of arched windows with Corinthian imposts, one in each bay.

There is no proper campanile, which is a witness to the financial problems involved in building the church. The bells are housed in an ugly and functional metal cage on the flat roof at the far left hand end.

=== Dome ===
The ribbed octagonal dome, erected in 1897, is a very early use of aluminium in architecture. It is thought to be the earliest known employment of the metal for the purpose of roofing, and the oldest known application still in service. It is pierced with six-pointed stars made of crystal glass, twenty-one in each sector arranged in alternate rows of four and three.

The rendered octagonal brick drum of the dome has a quatrefoil window in each side, in the same vaguely Gothic idiom as those in the pediments. It has a projecting cornice with modillions (little brackets), and is crowned by an attic plinth on which the actual dome sits. This attic has an oculus (round window) on each side, and a cornice molding which arcs over the windows. Each corner is occupied by an angels whose outspread wings reach back to the windows on each side.

There is a tall lantern on top of the dome, with eight arched openings separated by Corinthian half-columns. These support an entablature with putto's head finals and an ogee cupola. Uniquely, the cupola ends in a large metal finial in the form of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrance monstrance] holding the Blessed Sacrament.

=== Façade ===

==== Narthex frontage ====
The two-storey entrance façade is extremely impressive. 

The open narthex or loggia has six red granite columns with Corinthian capitals, and a pair of matching piers at the corners. These support an entablature with a dedicatory inscription on its frieze, which mentions the jubilee of Pope Leo, and a protruding cornice with both dentillations and modillions. 

Above the entablature is a large mosaic depicting allegorical figures representing the five continents, venerating the Blessed Sacrament exposed in a monstrance on an altar. There are two popes shown here, Pope Leo to the right and Pope [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VIII Clement VIII] to the left. Below is an epigraph title to the work: ''Orbis catholicae Romae divinis pro iuribus reparandis adoratio ''("Adoration for the reparation of divine justice at Rome by the Catholic world"), which indicates the original motivation for building the church.

On either side of the mosaic are two mosaics of saints, each round-headed mosaic in its own aedicule with a pair of Corinthian columns in bubblegum-pink and white marble supporting a triangular pediment. The marble is rare in Rome, and the consignment was a gift of Tsar [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia Alexander III] of Russia. The saints depicted are SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas Thomas Aquinas], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaventure Bonaventure], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi Clare] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Falconieri Juliana Falconieri]. The mosaic work was by Virgilio Monti.

On the flat roofline of the narthex is a plinth with set of three coats-of-arms, carved in relief. These are of Pope Leo, and two cardinals. The plinth bears a bronze statue of St Joachim with Our Lady as a little girl.

A further two aedicules are around the corner in the side frontages, and these frame windows which light the end rooms in the second storey (the central chamber, behind the large mosaic, houses the church organ).

The background surfaces overall are rendered in a cream colour.

=== Nave frontage ===
The actual frontage of the nave towers above the narthex, and is also rendered in a cream colour. Four Corinthian pilasters support an entablature without an architrave, but with square coffers containing rosettes as a sub-frieze in between the capitals. Above is a triangular pediment, and in its tympanum is a recessed motif of a cross with the Sacred Initials (IHS) in a frame formed geometrically from a square superimposed on a circle (the vaguely Gothic quatrefoil motif noted already). On either side of this in the tympanum is a venerating angel in mosaic. Between the inner pair of pilasters is a large round window in a dished and molded frame, and between the inner and outer pilasters is a pair of arched recesses with ribbed conchs having their archivolts supported by Corinthian pilasters and crowned with acanthus finials. These two recesses look as if they were intended to contain statues.

The tip of the pediment gable support a bronze finial of a cross on a globe. You can see two box plinths at the ends of the tympanum, which once had statues of standing angels (when were these removed?).

=== Narthex interior ===
Inside the narthex there are three entrance doorways with archivolt tympani containing mosaics. The central one features the Sacred Heart, the right hand one two birds drinking from a chalice and the left hand one, a dolphin supporting a cup. The side doors lead directly into the nave side aisles.

The central doorway is flanked by a pair of Corinthinan columns in the pink and white Russian marble. They support a posted entablature bearing the dished and molded tympanum archivolt, while the simpler archivolts of the side tympani are on floating cornices.

In between the doors are four round-headed recesses, which are empty but again look as if they were meant to contain statues.

A mosaic frieze below the ceiling displays the names of the nations contributing to the cost of the church, in blue medallions on a gold background with fronded ornament. The ceiling itself is coffered.

==Interior==

=== Layout and fabric ===
The impressive interior is lavishly decorated with fresco and polychrome marble work. This includes three mosaics by Silvio Galimberti. Other artists contributing to the decoration were Oreste Anfolsi, Cesare Cappabianca, Eugenio Cisterna, Raffaele Gagliardi, Silvio Galimberti, Virginio Monti, Attilio Palombi, Maximilian Schmatz and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Tripisciano Michele Tripisciano].

The nave has five bays, with aisles and side chapels. The transept has an apsidal chapel in each end. Beyond the transept there are three chapels and the sacristy, entered through antechambers in the sides of the sanctuary bay. The sanctuary itself is also apsidal.

=== Nave ===
The central nave is separated from the aisles by arcades, which have pinkish-grey granite Corinthian columns with bronze capitals. The arcade arches have coffered intradoses, and in the spandrels are tondi containing sculptured busts of the Apostles by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Tripisciano Michele Tripisciano]. Above each arcade is an entablature resting on the arch keystones, which has rosettes in relief and a dentillate cornice.

Above this entablature in turn are the gallery arches. Each side of each bay has two arches separated by a Corinthian column bearing a square impost, and containing gallery balustrades fronted in a diaper pattern. Each pair of arches is separated by a square pier. Above these gallery arches is a second entablature, from which the ceiling vault springs.

The vault is irregular, having two large sections spanning two bays at the front and back, and a smaller section in the middle spanning one bay. The larger sections are square cross-vaults, with angels frescoed on the side panels and three round windows in each side wall lunette. The central small section has its ribs meeting at the coat-of-arms of Pope Leo. The background of the vault surfaces is frescoed in a tessellated pattern in pale grey and tan with gilded details including rosettes, involving the vaguely Gothic rayed quatrefoil device already met with.

The counterfaçade has four granite Corinthian pilasters, the inner pair of which supports an archivolt over which the first entablature is taken. Above is the organ gallery, with a pair of arches flanked by two singletons separated by a pair of piers. The organ is of very high quality, and was assembled by Jules Annesseens Ruyssers of Belgium in 1908. It was restored in 2008. 

Above, in the vault lunette, is a large round window containing stained glass representing the twelve Apostles in roundels, with St Peter at the top and St Paul at the bottom. The Dove of the Holy Spirit in glory is depicted in the centre. This window is flanked by a pair of frescoes of angels playing harp and lute.

The side aisles are cross-vaulted as well, each bay having a square section of vaulting.

The free-standing maple-wood pulpit or ambo, on the left before the transept, is by [http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_S/Stuflesser_Ferdinand_1855_1926.xml Ferdinand Stuflesser]. The back panel shows ''Christ Preaching to the Crowd, ''and the panels on the pulpit itself show ''Christ with St Peter, St Paul, SS Joachim and Anne Teaching Our Lady to Read, St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonsus_Maria_de%27_Liguori Alphonsus de' Liguori] ''(here because he was the founder of the Redemptorists)'', Pope St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I Gregory the Great], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo Augustine], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome Jerome] ''and ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose Ambrose].''

=== Transept ===
The transept is accessed by a flight of four stairs from the central nave and the side aisles. It is dominated by the high dome, the interior of which is in dark blue with stars. The pendentives have depictions of angels. 

Below the dome is the modern altar ''pro populo, ''for Mass celebrated facing the congregation. It is a square mensa on a ribbed cylindrical block, recalling an early practice of using an ancient column drum to support an altar table.

The ends of the transept house spectacular chapels, the Italian to the left and the English to the right. They are described with the other national chapels below.

=== Sanctuary ===
The sanctuary has one bay, and then an apse of the same width with a tiny subsidiary apse containing the tabernacle. It is flanked by the French, American and Spanish chapels as well as the sacristy. The access to these off the sides of the bay is via a [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serliana serliana] in each side -an arch is supported on a pair of columns, with narrow rectangular openings on each side. This design feature is replicated in the gallery arch above.

The apse wall is clad in a pale greyish green veined marble, with an orange-red dado. The free-standing altar is in entirely in red marble, ''rosso dei piranei, ''with a gilt bronze cross on its frontal flanked by coats-of-arms of Pope Leo XIII also in bronze. It is approached by steps in a different red marble, ''rosso di Levante, ''and these steps continue on either side of it to the tabernacle niche. The ''gradino ''has a row of twenty tondi in green malachite -a rather alarming colour contrast.

The tabernacle is in an apsidal niche, with a spectacular triumphal arch with a molded, gilded and embellished archivolt on tripletted Corinthian pilasters in alabaster with gilded capitals. The conch is in blue glass with angels and a symbol of the Trinity. The neo-Baroque tabernacle is by [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Vermare André Vermare], and is in the form of a globe in pale blue and gold, accompanied by two angels in white marble holding candlesticks and another two kneeling on billowing clouds, with a gilt ribbon epigraph draped across them.

There is a pair of ''cantorie ''or opera-boxes for solo musicians flanking the archivolt of the tabernacle niche. Above is the conch entablature, having a deep red architrave and a frieze with an epigraph reading ''In omni loco sacrificatur et offeratur nomini meo oblatio munda ''("In every place is offered a sacrifice and pure offering to my name").

The conch is filled with an enormous fresco depicting ''The Triumph of the Eucharist. ''Christ enthroned presents his Body and Blood to be worshipped by the apostles. God the Father is above. In the background, to the right is Jerusalem and, to the left, Rome.

=== Baptistery ===
The baptistery has a relief sculpture of ''The Baptism of Christ'' by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Tripisciano Michele Tripisciano]. 

The side walls have a matching pair of frescoes each featuring a palm tree with seven streams flowing from its roots symbolizing the Seven Sacraments. This is accompanied by two angels holding items used in the rite of baptism. The symbol of seven streams of water is repeated in the lunettes, when they flow from a cross in each. The vault has ''coronae ''painted, of doves, flowers and winged putto's heads. The pendentives feature texts describing the effects of baptism. All this fresco work is by [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Cisterna Eugenio Cisterna]. 

The font is a calyx in white marble.

=== National chapels ===

==== Overall description ====
There are fourteen national chapels, each one named after the country that contributed to its decoration: Brazil, Portugal, Bavaria, Poland, Canada, England, USA, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland and Argentina.

There was some shuffling of responsibilities in the church's early days, and notably the Austrians gave up their chapel after they lost their empire in the First World War.

The chapels off the nave side aisles are narrow chambers separated by blocking walls, with a little elliptical cupola on pendentives. A round window is fitted into the back curve of the vault (which is a miniature version of the design of the counterfaçade). The archivolts of the entrance arches spring from granite semi-columns on the piers separating the chapels.

The decoration is a treasure-house of depictions of saints, many of whom are unfamiliar in Rome.

==== Brazilian Chapel ====
The chapel sponsored by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil Brazil] was designed by Cesare Cappabianca, with fresco work by Cisterna. The impressive gilded wooden [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyptych polyptych], by Oreste Anfolzi, rather dominates the little polychrome marble altar which has relief carving of two heraldic shields including that of Brazil. These are within a frontal arcade of three arches, springing from imposts on six little columns in red marble.

The central panel of the polyptych depicts [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyptych Our Lady of Aparecida], venerated at the most famous Marian shrine in Brazil. She is flanked by SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sebastian Sebastian] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle Paul the Apostle] (patrons of Brazil), while above are ''God the Father ''in the middle, St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_of_Padua Anthony of Padua] to the left and St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary Elizabeth of Hungary] to the right.

The polyptych obscures two side wall paintings, ''The First Proclamation of the Faith in Brazil ''and ''The First Celebration of Mass in Brazil. ''The left hand lunette shows a group of martyrs, and the right hand one ''The Miraculous Discovery of the Aparecida Image. ''The cupola shows Our Lady as the Protectress of Latin America, with the constellation of the Southern Cross to the left. The round window has stained glass displaying the national heraldry of Brazil.

The entrance archway has frescoes of Pope St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_X Pius X] and Cardinal [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Arcoverde_de_Albuquerque_Cavalcanti Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti], the former having made the latter the first cardinal from Latin America. They are accompanied by St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph Joseph] and St Joachim, their respective patrons, and two tondi show scenes of ''The Proclamation of Arcoverde as Cardinal ''and ''The Gratitude to Pope St Pius of the Brazilian Nation.''

==== Portuguese Chapel ====
The chapel sponsored by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal Portugal] was designed by Virginio Monti. It is rich in fresco depictions of saints.

The altar is in red Sicilian jasper, edged with yellow Siena marble, and has an altarpiece statue of St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_of_Padua Anthony of Padua] in a round-headed niche above (he is here because he came from Portugal). Above him is a depiction of the Sacred Heart, and he is flanked by representations of (left to right) SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Donjeon William of Bourges], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Anne Anne], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mary_Alacoque Margaret Mary] (not yet canonized when this was painted) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Clairvaux Bernard].

The left hand wall has a depiction of ''Christ with Martha and Mary, Sisters of Lazarus, ''which is flanked by depictions of St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_the_Apostle Andrew the Apostle] and "Blessed" [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alano_della_Rupe Alan de la Roche] (not formally beatified). The right hand wall depicts ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_roses The Miracle of the Roses], ''which here is associated with St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Aragon Elizabeth of Portugal] (having been stolen for the purpose from St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary Elizabeth of Hungary]). To the sides are SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_of_Chartres Ivo of Chartres] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_of_Jerusalem Simon of Jerusalem] (?).

Above the main frescoes is a row of tondo portraits of saints. There is a total of twelve of these, given as: St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Giles Giles], "Gundisano" (no such saint exists), Bl [http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-jane-of-portugal/ Jane of Portugal], Bl [http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-gundisalvus-of-lagos/ Gundisalvus of Lagos], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_of_Portugal,_Queen_of_Le%C3%B3n Teresa of Portugal], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarcisius Tarcisius], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_God John of God], Bl [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancha,_Lady_of_Alenquer Sancha], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theotonius Theotonius], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Tomar Irene of Santarém], St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_de_Brito John de Brito] and Bl [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafalda_of_Portugal Mafalda].

The side lunettes depict ''The Holy Family, ''and ''St Anthony Heals a Child. ''The window has stained glass in the form of a floral wreath surrounding a fleur-de-lys, and is flanked by a saintly king ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_I_of_Portugal Afonso I], the founder of Portugal?) and a martyr (St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Saragossa Vincent]?).

The cupola shows ''The Apotheosis of St Anthony, ''and the pendentives show SS Peter, Paul, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James,_son_of_Zebedee James the Great] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Marcellus_I Marcellus the Pope]. The entrance archway has SS John the Baptist and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillus_de_Lellis Camillus de Lellis].

==== Bavarian Chapel ====
The chapel sponsored by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria Bavaria] was a late fitting-out, supervised by Maximilian Schmaltz who was  one of the Redemptorists. The sculptural work on the altar frontal was done by Giovanni Scrivo, to designs by Schmaltz. It features two reliefs, one of ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchizedek Melchizedek] Offers Bread and Wine ''and the other of ''Aaron Offers Incense.''

The walls and vault are entirely and superbly frescoed. The main painting over the altar depicts ''Emperor St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor Henry II] Approves the Foundation of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral Bamberg Cathedral]. ''He is accompanied by his wife, St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunigunde_of_Luxembourg Cunegund]. There are four saints accompanying the main fresco, helpfully labelled: SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burchard_of_W%C3%BCrzburg Burchard of Würzburg], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Pirmin Pirmin], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_of_Regensburg Wolfgang of Regensburg] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Kilian Killian]. Above, the round window has stained glass showing a wreath surrounding a fleur-de-lys, and is accompanied by SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Walpurga Walburga] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Erentrude Erentrude].

The left hand side wall has ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_of_Lorch Maximilian of Lorch] Rebukes the Prefect Eulasius, ''with side panels showing SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willibald Willibald], [http://catholicsaints.info/saint-valentine-of-passau/ Valentine of Passau], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergilius_of_Salzburg Virgil of Salzburg] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebhard_of_Constance Gebhard of Constance].

The right hand side wall shows ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_of_Lorchhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_of_Salzburg Rupert of Salzburg] Baptizes Duke [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodo_of_Bavaria Theodo] of Bavaria.

The entrance archway features SS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Florian Florian] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface Boniface].

==== Polish Chapel ====
