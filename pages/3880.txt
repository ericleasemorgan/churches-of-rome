'''San Fedele da Sigmaringa '''is a later 20th century parish church at Via Mesula 4 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietralata_(quartiere_di_Roma) Pietralata] quarter, east of the junction of the Via Nomentana with the Circonvallazione Salaria. It is up a cul-de-sac off the street named, and can be difficult to find. It is the first on the right after the junction with the Via di Pietralata.

== History ==
The parish was set up in 1970, and the church erected in 1973. Initially it was in the charge of the Venetian province of the Franciscan [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin Capuchins], but is now in the care of diocesan clergy.

== Appearance ==
This is a simple building, in the form of a barn with a pitched and trussed roof in red tiles and the exterior walls rendered in cream. The right hand side wall has four rectangular windows, but the left hand side abuts the parish offices. 

There is a little tower campanile on the top left hand corner, with an arched sound-hole in each side and a tiled pyramidal cap. 

The open entrance porch has a single-pitched tiled canopy supported to two black metal piers, and with a hip at the right hand end. The left hand end joins onto the large ancillary complex that abuts the left hand side of the church. The porch has a circular window above it. 

Gratifyingly, there is a decent set of devotional statues of saints within to be venerated rather than admired as artworks, including one to the patron who was a Capuchin preacher martyred by Calvinists in Switzerland in 1622.

== Liturgy ==
In the winter of 2017, Mass was celebrated:

Weekdays 9:00 (also 18:00 on Fridays);

Sundays and Solemnities 9:00, 10:30, 12:00.

In the summer of 2016, weekday Masses were at 9:00 and Sunday ones at 10:30 only.
