'''Santa Maria Odigitria al Tritone '''is a 19th century confraternity, regional and titular church on 16th century foundations at Via del Tritone 82, north of the Quirinal Palace in the rione Colonna. Picture of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colonna_-_santa_Maria_Odigitria_01608.JPG here].
==Name==
The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her ancient title of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodegetria Hodegetria] or "She Who Shows the Way". Hence ''Odigitria ''in Italian. 

Two alternative names of ''Santa Maria d'Itria and Santa Maria di Costantinopoli ''have been used in the past, but the official name is as given.

==History==
===Hodegetria===
The title ''Odegitria ''refers to an ancient devotion to Our Lady in Sicily. ''Hodegetria'' is Greek for “Showing the Way”, and refers to a very old style of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_art Byzantine] icon depicting the Madonna and Child. In this, perhaps the most familar of Byzantine icon types of Our Lady, she is depicted holding the Christ Child on one arm and pointing to him with her other hand. 

According to the Sicilian legend, the devotion arose when a flotilla of ships from the island helped to defeat an attack on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople Constantinople] by "Turks" in the 8th century when the island was still part of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire Byzantine Empire]. This is a garbled rememberance of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(860) Siege of Constantinople] by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus%27_people Rus'] in 860, when an apparition of Our Lady helped the Byzantines to score a victory. The event is still celebrated in Orthodox churches as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercession_of_the_Theotokos Pokrov] or ''Skepe, ''meaning "protection". (The Turks were still chasing sheep around the central Asian steppes at the time.)

''Itria'' is a corruption of the word ''Hodegetria, ''not a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria Istria].
===Foundation===
The church has its origins in an association of six Sicilian expatriates resident at Rome, at a time when [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily Sicily] was ruled by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon Kingdom of Aragon] (by then united to Spain). They obtained recognition as a pious Confraternity from Pope [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VIII Clement VIII] in 1594, and immediately began building a headquarters with a church. With the help of a large benefaction from King [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain Philip II] of Spain, they were able to have it consecrated in 1596.

They had possession of an ancient Byzantine icon of Our Lady, which they enshrined in their new church and which also gave its name to the confraternity:'' Arciconfraternita di Santa Maria Odigitria dei Siciliani'', which still exists as a charitable organization. The church became the national church of Sicily in Rome.
===Ruination===

in 1720, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies Kingdom of the Two Sicilies] became independent. This ruled the island of Sicily, but had its capital at Naples. However, the monarchs remained patrons and benefactors of the church and confraternity.

In 1798, the pope was deposed and a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic_(18th_century) Roman Republic] declared in response to the French Revolution. The army of King [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_the_Two_Sicilies Ferdinand] of the Two Sicilies briefly occupied the city, and a liturgy of thanksgiving was celebrated in the church. However, the king retreated in the face of Napoleon's advance and the returning French troops despoiled and desecrated the church in revenge. The building was rented out as a small shop, but seems to have fallen into complete ruin. The confraternity was suppressed temporarily.
===Rebuilding===
The confraternity was refounded by 1805, and set about the project of rebuilding. However, this was a slow process. The complex was ready for occupation in [[1814]], and the church was rebuilt by 1817 to a design by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Manno Francesco Manno] (better known as a painter). King Ferdinand put up much of the cost.

In the early 20th century, the confraternity became run-down and was almost dispersed. However, matters were taken in hand and the church was restored in 1970. In 1973, it was made titular. A replacement icon for the main altar was donated by Patriarch [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Athenagoras_I_of_Constantinople Athenagoras] of Constantinople, and in 1988 the side altars were given new altarpieces by Sicilian artists.

A renewal of interest in the confraternity has led to the creation of a faculty of theology, and a study centre for Sicilian history and culture.

The church is now (July 2018) in the care of the ''Sorelle Francescane del Vangelo.'' This new congregation of sisters was founded at Monreale, Sicily in 1976 and is under the authority of the archbishop of Palermo.
===Cardinalate===
The title is that of a cardinal deacon. The present incumbent is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Romeo Paolo Romeo], archbishop of Palermo.
==Exterior==
===Layout and fabric===
The church is on the plan of a simple rectangle, with a shallow apsed sanctuary the same width as the nave.

It is possible that fabric from the earlier church was preserved in the present one after rebuilding, but the side walls cannot be examined because of adjacent buildings. There is a small campanile or bellcote over the apse, but this is invisible from the street.
===Façade===
The two-storey façade is very plain, in travertine limestone. The door has a horizontal floating cornice, and the corners of the first storey are carved with blind pilasters in shallow relief. These support an entablature with a projecting cornice but no architrave. The only decoration in this storey is a tablet with a short dedicatory inscription. Two wings on either side of the main frontage of this storey have vertical ovoid windows. 

The second storey of the façade has a large semi-circular lunette window, below a triangular pediment having a recessed blank tympanum. That is it.
==Interior==
===Layout and fabric===
The small but richly decorated neo-Baroque interior is basically a rectangular box, with four side altars. It is dominated by Corinthian pilasters in yellow marble with travertine capitals in a derivative style, which support an entablature running round the church. The barrel-vaulted ceiling, which has window lunettes, sits on this. It is coffered in panels of different sizes embellished with gilt vine-scrolls, and with heraldry in the larger ones.

The large semi-circular window in the counterfaçade has stained glass featuring the Dove of the Holy Spirit.
===Sanctuary===

The famous icon is enthroned over the altar, in a very large gilt glory. There is no proper aedicule, two of the Corinthian pilasters (doubletted here) forming a frame instead. A triangular pediment is over the entablature. The altar frontal is in red marble and alabaster.
===Side altars===

There are four side altars, and the paintings over them since 1988 are: ''Popes [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_II Leo II] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Agatho Agatho], and St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodios_I_of_Constantinople Methodius of Constantinople]'' by Giuseppe Migneco; ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucy Lucy]'' by Salvatore Fiume; ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_of_Sicily Agatha]'' by Sebastiano Milluzzo and ''St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Rosalia Rosalia]'' by Mario Bardi. All of these were Sicilians (in the case of Pope St Agatho, only allegedly).
===Oratory===

The Archconfraternity’s private oratory, which is adjacent to the church, has another painting of St Rosalia by Gaetano Sottini.
