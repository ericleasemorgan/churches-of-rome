==History==

The building was originally a pagan temple, probably constructed on the orders of the 2nd century Athenian philanthropist Herodes Atticus. In the 10th century, the structure was modified and consecrated as a church.

It was altered in the 17th century.
==Exterior==

The columns at the front of the building originally formed part of a portico, but walls were added in [[1634]].
