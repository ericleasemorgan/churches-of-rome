'''Santa Maria Madre del Buon Consiglio a Saline '''is a late 20th century public chapel at Via Anselmo Banduri. This is in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_di_Ostia Saline di Ostia], which is immediately adjacent to [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica Ostia Antica] on the east.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel Our Lady of Good Counsel]"

== History ==
This is a dependent chapel of the parish of [[Sant'Aurea a Ostia Antica]], and was opened in the late 20th century. By the look of its location it is marking the place for a possible future parish church, but there seem to be no plans for future development yet.

== Appearance ==
The chapel has no street number. It is at the back of a city block on the north side of the street, towards its west end.

This is a simple prefabricated structure, rectangular with four bays, side walls in white and a gabled roof in red. Each bay has a horizontal rectangular window below the roofline. The fa√ßade is in pale orange, with a single window above the entrance. The left hand side, away from the street, is occupied by a lean-to ancillary range.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities at 11:00, according to the Diocese (July 2018).[[Category:Outside the walls - South-West]]
