'''Santissimo Redentore e Santa Francesca Saverio Cabrini '''is an early 20th century convent church at Via Sicilia 215 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovisi_(rione_di_Roma) rione Ludovisi]. Picture of the church at Wikimedia Commons [[commons:File:Ludovisi_-_SS._Redentore.jpg|here]]. 

The dedication is to Christ the Redeemer, and St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Xavier_Cabrini Frances-Xavier Cabrini].
==History==

The edifice was designed by one Cucco as the convent chapel of the Sisters, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_Sisters_of_the_Sacred_Heart_of_Jesus Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus], and completed in 1906 in a style described as neo-Lombard Romanesque but with Gothic elements. 
==Exterior==

The fabric is puce brick on a stone plinth, with narrow horizontal stripes in red brick numbering twenty-four in total. 

The gabled entrance façade is flanked by two gigantic brick pilasters at the corners, which reach the roofline although without capitals. 

The doorcase, which has a dedicatory inscription on its lintel, is surmounted by a Gothic arch enclosing a small statue of Christ and is flanked by two round pilasters with simplified Corinthian capitals of rather Ancient Egyptian appearance. These pilasters are continued upwards beyond their capitals by a pair of spirelets in the Baroque style, flanking the Gothic arch. 

There are two simple single –light Gothic windows midway up the façade, and a wheel window in stone below the gable. The windows in the main body of the church are to the same pattern as the façade pair. 

The façade roofline only is decorated with a frieze of pendant Gothic arches resting on corbals. Unfortunately the design includes two bellcotes with gabled tops on the corners of the façade roofline, and these spoil the appearance of the building, especially since they have no bells. 
==Interior==

The interior is notable for a series of paintings by Ciotti (1952) depicting the life and miracles of St Frances-Xavier Cabrini.
