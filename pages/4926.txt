'''Madonna della Strada '''was a later 20th century public chapel at Via Paolo Ferrari 69 in the suburb of Madonna di Bracciano, which is off the Via Braccianese near the Olgiata train station and north-west of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Storta La Storta].

The dedication was to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her title of "Our Lady of the Road".

This chapel was in the municipality of Rome, but belonged to the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina]. It was a Mass centre attached to the parish of [[Sacri Cuori di Ges√π e Maria di Porto Santa Rufina]].

Mass was being celebrated on Sundays at 9:30 in 2012, but is no longer advertised and it seems that this chapel is now closed down.

The edifice is a flat-roofed prefab behind an apartment block.
