==Appearance==

The little church is on a rectangular plan and is shaped like a prism. The façade is hence in the shape of a triangle, most of which is taken up by a very large triangular window with narrow vertical bars and decorated by horizontal rectangular panels in a semi-random pattern. The façade either side of the entrance, below the window, is in pink brick.
