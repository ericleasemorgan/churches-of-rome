'''Santa Maria Stella Maris a Mostacciano '''is a 20th century subsidiary church of the parish of [[Santa Maria del Carmelo a Mostacciano]] , and is located at Via Sergio De Vitis 100 in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostacciano Mostacciano], to the north of Spinaceto and just south-west of the junction between the Via Pontina and the Circonvallazione Meridionale ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Raccordo_Anulare Grande Raccordo Anulare]).

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady,_Star_of_the_Sea Star of the Sea].

== History ==
This church was built in the later 20th century to serve a suburban area seriously cut off from its parish church, which is on the other side of a major road interchange. It is itself not easy to find.

The Diocese refers to it as a church, which is a hint that it might have become a parish church in its own right in the future if the suburb (called Mostacciano B) had been developed to the south. However, the present layout of development makes this unlikely because the next suburb that has now arisen to the south (called [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casal_Brunori Casal Brunori]) has completely separate access.

== Appearance ==
The church is a simple rectangular brick building, with walls rendered in orange and with a pitched and tiled roof having overhanging eaves. The nave is of four bays, each with a facing pair of horizontal rectangular windows in its side walls which have curved lintels. The sanctuary end is occupied by an ancillary block on a transverse axis, forming a T. This has its own pitched and tiled roof.

The façade is blank-walled, with a single doorway having a curved lintel in the same style as the side windows. Above it is an oculus (round window).

A tiny campanile or bellcote sits on the roof ridge just behind the façade gable, having a round-headed bell housing for a single bell and a tiled cap.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated (parish website, June 2018):

Weekdays 18:00;

Sundays and Solemnities 9:00, 11:00.
