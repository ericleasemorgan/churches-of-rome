'''Santa Chiara a Vigna Clara '''is a mid 20th century parish and titular church at Via Riccardo Zandonai 4, in the Della Vittoria district just by the old Via Cassia. Pictures of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Santa_Chiara_a_Vigna_Clara_(Rome)?uselang=it here]. There is an English Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Chiara_a_Vigna_Clara here].

The dedication is to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi St Clare].

== History ==
The church was designed by Alberto Ressa and structurally completed in 1959, the year of the foundation of the new parish, although consecration was delayed until 1962 when the interior was finished.

It was made titular in 1969, and the present cardinal priest is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinko_Pulji%C4%87 Vinko Puljic].

==Exterior==

The church is on a perfectly circular plan and has a squat central tower, imitating [http://Santo Stefano Rotondo al Celio] somewhat. However, the tower is offset towards the altar. The main roof is flat, with projecting eaves, and the outer wall is rendered in pinkish orange. There is a row of individual horizontally rectangular windows about three quarters of the way up, running round the church except for either side of the entrance. Flanking the entrance, and at intervals around the circuit, this row of windows is enlivened by the insertion of a Greek cross device made up of four square windows in a larger square and another four forming the arms. 

The tower has a slightly conical roof, and is in pinkish brown with darker horizontal stripes. Over the entrance this tower has a large grouping of vertically rectangular windows, fifteen arranged five by three and and three more at top and bottom. Each window has mullions in the form of two Greek crosses, one above the other.

==Interior==

Behind the altar is a triple apse, although this is not external to the circular plan. The frescoes in this are by Mariano Villalta, depicting the Annunciation, Nativity and Last Supper.
