}}
'''Santissimo Crocifisso della Ferratella '''was a small devotional chapel that stood in what is now the Piazza di Porta Metronia. This is in the present rione [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celio_(rione_di_Roma) Celio].

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Nolli#Nolli_Map Nolli map] of 1748 shows it on the south side of the then road junction; the way through the ancient walls did not exist then and the junction was called the Piazza della Ferratella.

It contained a venerated crucifix, but was derelict by the end of the 19th century. 

The site is right in the middle of the present road junction, between the end of the Via di Navicella and the north portal of the gateway.
