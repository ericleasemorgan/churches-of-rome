'''Santa Maria Rosa Molas '''is a 20th century convent chapel at Via Cervino 6 which is in the meander of the Aniene river south-east of the Ponte Tazio. This is part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomentano Nomentana] quarter.

The dedication is to St [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Rosa_Molas Maria-Rosa Molas y Vallvé], and is unique in Rome.

== History ==
The saint founded the ''[https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermanas_de_Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_de_la_Consolaci%C3%B3n Hermanas de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación]'' (Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation or ''Suore di Nostra Signora della Consolazione'') at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa Tortosa] in Spain in 1858.

The congregation established its headquarters in Rome in the mid 20th century, and built a large three and four storey edifice. However, at the end of the same century the Generalate was moved to a villa at Via Aurelia 300 and the convent converted to a pilgrims' hotel. This is the ''Villa Maria Rosa Molas'', which has a good reputation. Apparently only one sister is in residence.

The chapel is dependent on the parish of [[Santi Angeli Custodi]], but has no public liturgical activity.

== Appearance ==
The chapel has no separate architectural identity. A photo of the interior is [http://www.hotel.de/media/hotel/pictures/288/288983/Other_635427429266707370.jpg here].
