'''Santa Maria Consolatrice a Labaro '''is a 20th century public chapel at Via Francesco Torfanini 27 in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labaro_(Roma) Labaro], north-west of the junction between the Via Flaminia and the Grande Raccordo Anulare (Circonvallazione Settentrionale).

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her title of "Our Lady, Consoler".

== History ==
The Sisters of Holy Mary the Consoler (''Suore di Maria Santissima Consolatrice'') were founded in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin Turin] in 1893.

Their convent with its chapel was founded in 1954, and was the original place of worship in the suburb of Labaro. The parish of [[San Melchiade]] was set up in 1959, but was provided with a new church of its own in 1976. The chapel remains an external Mass centre for the parish.

The sisters run a refuge for vulnerable women and their children, called the ''Istituto Maria Consolatrice''.

== Appearance ==
The chapel is part of the convent building, but has its own façade. The pitched roof forms a low gable, below which is a blank wall in a dirty white render. The entire façade, including the gable, has a slightly raised border in dull orange.

The single entrance has a single-pitched tiled canopy supported on a pair of wooden struts. Above is a small rectangular window inserted into a diapered square recess (that is, a square standing on its corner). This also has an orange frame, and is covered with a decorative metal grille incorporating a cross.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated daily at 8:30 (parish website, June 2018).
