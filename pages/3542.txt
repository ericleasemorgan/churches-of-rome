'''Sacro Cuore di Ges√π al Casale Rocchi '''is a mid 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[San Fidele da Sigmaringa|San Fedele da Sigmaringa]] , and is located at Via del Casale Rocchi 57. This is in the rather isolated suburb of Casal Rocchi, part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietralata_(quartiere_di_Roma) Pietralata] quarter.

The dedication is to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart Sacred Heart].

== Appearance ==
This is a straightforward little building on a rectangular plan, having a shallow pitched and tiled roof and two vertical rectangular windows in each side wall. The ones in the left hand wall are above an appended sacristy and accommodation block. The entrance has a floating tiled canopy with a single pitch downwards, and a round window above this.

The exterior is rendered in a pale pinkish orange, except for the doorcase which is in light grey and a string course in the same colour which runs round the exterior at the level marked by the top of the entrance canopy.

A single bell in a metal bar bell-cage is over the left hand side wall.

The interior is painted in white, but the ceiling-less roof has its rafters stained in dark brown. A polychrome statue of the Sacred Heart is in a shallow round-headed niche in the far wall. Two more such niches are in the side walls, between the windows, and contain statues of Our Lady and St Joseph.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated here on Saturdays at 18:00, except for July and August when the chapel is closed.
