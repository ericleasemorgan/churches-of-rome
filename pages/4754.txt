'''San Gabriele Arcangelo ''' is a mid 20th century parish and titular church at Viale Cortina d’Ampezzo 144, between the Via Trionfale and Via Cassia in the suburban district (''Suburbio'') of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Della_Vittoria_(suburbio_di_Roma) Della Vittoria]. Pictures of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:San_Gabriele_arcangelo_(Rome)?uselang=it here].

The dedication is to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel Gabriel the Archangel]. 

== History ==
The parish was erected in 1956, and given into the administration of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocationist_Fathers Society of Divine Vocations] (the Vocationists). The church was completed in the same year.

It was made titular in 1988, and the present cardinal priest is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Estepa_Llaurens José Manuel Estepa Llaurens] . The title is ''San Gabriele Arcangelo all'Acqua Traversa, ''which is not the church's actual name.

A community of Vocationist Sisters has been established nearby. 

Also, at Viale Cortina d'Ampezzo 226 is a school established in 1947 by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piarists Piarists], called the ''Istituto San Giuseppe Calasanzio. ''The parish is using the chapel here as a public Mass centre, but it has no formal dedication nor separate architectural identity.

== Appearance ==
The plan is basically that of a quarter-circle or half-closed fan, although the straight sides of this are occupied by walls which form right-angled steps in the plan in order to accommodate ancillary rooms. This is an early expression of the belated realization among church architects in Rome that modern churches do not have to be basilical in layout.

The rather low exterior walls are rendered in pale orange, and the double entrance is midway along the curved wall. 

The roof has a complex form. It is flat around the eaves, but in its central zone are three triangular zones (actually sectors of circles) which are raised, and which have strips of windows in between themselves and the rest of the roof. They meet at a point just above the altar. Looking from in front of the entrance, the left hand one is the largest, and is supported by little vertical slabs decorated with a vertical groove each. There is a double row of windows, tilted slightly backwards, and the roof sector itself also slopes backwards. The middle sector is the lowest, immediately above the left hand entrance. The right hand one is of intermediate height, and slopes also down from left to right. It slightly overlaps the middle sector.

Descriptions and photos of the interior are lacking online. 

The artist Vera Puoti (her website is [http://www.verapuoti.it/ here]) was commissioned to paint two works for the church in 2007. One is ''La Madonna del Salve Regina ''(image [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiesa_di_San_Gabriele_Arcangelo#/media/File:Madonna_del_Salve_Regina_(_immagine_grande).jpg here]), and the other is ''Il'' ''Ritratto del Beato [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giustino_Russolillo Giustino Russolillo] ''(article [http://www.bta.it/txt/a0/04/bta00481.html here])''. ''He was the founder of the Vocationist family of religious.
