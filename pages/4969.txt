'''Santa Maria Mater Purissima a Ponte Linari '''is a later 20th century public chapel located at Via del Muro Linari 12 which is in the suburban hamlet of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Linari Ponte Linari] on the other side of Via Tuscolana from the suburb of Casal Morena. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrenova_(zona_di_Roma) Torrenova] zone.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "Purest of Mothers".

== History ==
This chapel was originally built sometime in the mid 20th century, when the locality was still countryside. Nearby is the so-called [http://www.medioevo.roma.it/html/architettura/torri-ext/tex-ss_quattro.htm Torre dei Santi Quattro], a mediaeval fortified tower once owned by the monastery of [[Santi Quattro Coronati]].

After 1975 the chapel became part of the facilities of the parish of [[San Girolamo Emiliani]], administered by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaschi_Fathers Clerks Regular of Somascha]. It must have been rebuilt in the Eighties or thereabouts, although on its original plan (this is obvious from comparing an old photo on the parish website with its present appearance).

Very little information is available concerning this edifice -''info.roma'' has not noticed its existence yet.

== Exterior ==
This attractive little free-standing building has the plan of a regular octagon. Thin grey concrete piers occupy the corners, which support corbels themselves supporting a zig-zag set of concrete beams forming the roofline. Each side of the octagon has a gable, giving the roof eight double pitches meeting at a small lantern.

The walls are of pink brick, finely laid, except for the triangular zones below the gables which are rendered in white.  

The single entrance doorway is unadorned. Above is a niche with a three-sided polygonal top, containing a simple cross in white. The diagonal sides each have a single window with a triangular top.

The sanctuary is a shallow rectangular apse with a double-pitched roof bearing the campanile. This is two vertical beams capped by two concrete slabs forming a gable, from which hangs the single bell. Attached to the apse is a tiny sacristy block.

== Interior ==
The interior is simply decked out in white, with the corners having thin piers in naked red brick. The longitudinal sides each have a rectangular niche in pale blue, containing statues of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Sacred Heart.

The sanctuary has a large, shallow triangular-headed niche also painted blue, in which a crucifix is hung.

The most interesting thing in here is a votive-candle stand in the form of a tree, made out of welded bits of steel. It stands in front of a picture of the Madonna and Child hanging on a wall.

== Liturgy ==
According to an unofficial source in 2015, Mass was being celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities (only) at 10:30.
