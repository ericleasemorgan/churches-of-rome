'''Sacro Cuore di Gesù delle Suore Riparatrici''' is a 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santa Maria Mediatrice alla Borgata Gordiani]], and is located at Via Isabella De Rosis 4 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenestino-Labicano Prenestino-Labicano] quarter. 

The dedication is to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart Sacred Heart]. 

== History ==
This is a convent chapel of the Sisters, ''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_riparatrici_del_Sacro_Cuore Suore Riparatrici del Sacro Cuore]'' who run an infants' school here.

The congregation was founded in Naples in 1875, but decided to establish its Generalate at Rome after developing an international outreach. This was opened in 1962, and is at Via Gregorio XI 26. See [[Cappella delle Suore Riparatrici del Sacro Cuore]]. The ''Istituto Sacro Cuore ''followed quickly.

The chapel of the school is being used as a Mass centre by the parish.

== Appearance ==
The chapel has no separate architectural identity, and the complex is boring architecturally. The only point of interest is a large statue in a niche high up on the wall facing the main street, the niche having a very acute angled top.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated publicly at 9:30 on Sundays and Solemnities, and 17:30 on the days before.
