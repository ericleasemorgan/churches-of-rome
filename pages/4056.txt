'''Santa Dorotea a Tuscolano''' is the 20th century chapel of a large convent of the Sisters of St Dorothy (''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_di_Santa_Dorotea_della_Frassinetti Suore di Santa Dorotea]'') at Via Matera 18 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscolano Tuscolano] district. This is now better known as the ''Istituto Santa Dorotea della Frassinetti -Villa Paola ''which is a large and well-regarded private school.

The dedication is to St [[wikipedia:Dorothea_of_Caesarea|Dorothy]].

The large chapel occupies the second storey of one wing, and has the proportions of a church. There are no aisles, but the side walls are arcaded over windows which are separated by pilasters formed of slabs of veined white marble reaching up to a cornice. The stonework of the arcading is attractively horizontally banded in pink, yellow and grey blocks. There are smaller windows above the cornice, and the ceiling is flat with rafters.

There is a very attractive neo-Baroque apse, with a main altarpiece showing the Holy Family. This is flanked by frescoes of saints which are separated by pilasters in what looks like dark green marble and which have gilded Corinthinan capitals. The conch of the apse has five low arched windows with stained glass roundels immediately above the apse cornice, and these are separated by ribs which run up to a point behind the triumphal arch. The latter displays a coat-of-arms and is flanked by another pair of frescoes on the spandrels. The underside of the arch is coffered.
