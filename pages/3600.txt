}}
'''Santa Maria del Servizio alla Borgata del Podere Buccari '''was a later 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santa Brigida di Svezia]] , and was located at Via Usseglio 44 in the Borgata del Podere Buccari. 

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under the unusual title of "Our Lady of Service".

== Setting ==
The small and self-contained suburb is located between Ottavia and Primavalle, on the other side of the Circonvallazione Settentrionale from Selva Candida.

The chapel was a room in a house.

== Present status ==
As at 2016 the chapel is no longer advertised on the parish website, although the Diocese continues to list it with a Mass on Sundays and Solemnities at 11:00.

What seems to have happened here is that the chapel is now closed down, and that the pastoral outreach for the locality is met by the hospital church of [[Santa Maria della Provvidenza alla Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi]]. This is nearby.

Examination of the premises show no evidence of a chapel here now, and the gate now has an entry-pad.[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
