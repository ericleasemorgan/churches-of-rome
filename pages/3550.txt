'''Sant’Elisabetta a Valle Muricane '''is an early 20th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[Sant'Alfonso de'Liguori a Labaro|Sant’Alfonso de’Liguori a Labaro]], and is at Via di Santa Cornelia 73 ("km 3") in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_Porta Prima Porta] zone. 

== History ==
There is a surprising lack of information about this edifice, but "info.roma" has it as early 20th century. It should not be confused with [[Santi Elisabetta e Zaccaria]], a new parish church in the suburb of Valle Muricana some distance to the south-east.

== Appearance ==
This simple and rustic little building is all on its own in a field off the road, approached by a grass path through a gate. There is no other building nearby. 

The edifice has a single nave, and a three-sided polygonal apse with a window in each of its diagonal sides. The nave has two pairs of square windows low down in its right hand side wall, but only one pair in the near left hand side wall since a sacristy annexe with a single-pitched tiled roof attaches further down.

A pair of external chapels flank the nave at its far end, each polygonal with five sides and no windows.

The fabric is rendered in pale pink. 

The frontage has an entrance loggia with a sloping tiled roof and three entrance arches, the middle one being larger. This is rendered in a cream colour. Above, on the gable is a bellcote with openings for two bells and its own gable.

== Access and liturgy ==
Bus service 033 stops at "Santa Cornelia -Civico 115" nearby.

The Via di Santa Cornelia is very long. The chapel is off its south end, near the junction with the Via della Giustiniana.

There is no information available online on liturgical activities, if any. The site is gated, and there is no information notice provided here either.
