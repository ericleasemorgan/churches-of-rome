'''San Giuseppe al Casale Cesarina '''is a 17th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[Sant'Alessandro]] , and is at Via della Cesarina 212 in the Tor San Giovanni zone. This is due north of the junction between the Via Nomentana and the Circonvallazione Settentrionale.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph Joseph].

The chapel belongs to an old farmstead called ''Casale Cesarina ''which is in an entirely rural location and remains a working farm.

Mass is celebrated here at 9:00 on Sundays and Solemnities (parish website, May 2018).
