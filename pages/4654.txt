'''Madonna del Rosario a Via Laurentina '''is an early 20th century public dependent chapel, located on the roundabout (gyratory) between the Via Laurentina and Via di Vallerano. This is next to the small suburb of Valleranello, just south of the Circonvallazione Meridionale and in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallerano_(zona_di_Roma) Vallerano] suburban zone.

The dedication is to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_the_Rosary Our Lady of the Rosary].
==History==
The chapel was apparently erected in the first decade of the 20th century, and is now next to a new road junction on the Via Laurentina intended to serve new suburban development in the locality.

It was initially the responsibility of the parish of [[Gesù Divin Salvatore]], but was closed down at some stage.However, in 2010 it was restored as a private venture by the Nenni family, and re-opened as a place of worship. It is now under the care of the parish of [[San Carlo Borromeo a Fonte Laurentina]].

The site is still surrounded by fields although the suburbs are getting close.
==Appearance==
The edifice looks like a church, being in a vaguely Gothic style. It is a little rectangular building, with whitewashed walls and a gabled tiled roof having protruding eaves. There is a nave of three bays, and a sanctuary occupying a further bay which has its own lower roof.

The nave has a three pointed Gothic windows outlined in brick in each side wall, and two more flanking the entrance. The latter is also in the shape of a Gothic arch, outlined in brick and with a fresco of Our Lady in the tympanum above the door.

There is a little bellcote or campanile over the bottom right hand corner.
==Liturgy==
Mass is celebrated on Sundays at 10:30 (diocesan web-page for parish, June 2018).
