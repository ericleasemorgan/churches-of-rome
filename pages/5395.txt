== History ==
The ''Compagnia della Regina dei Gigli ''("Society of the Queen of Lilies") was founded in1935 by Madre Liliana del Paradiso at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Giorgio_a_Cremano San Giorgio a Cremano] which is now a suburb of Naples. This pious society includes both laity and clergy. Its headquarters in the centre of the town, and has a very impressive modern church in a traditional style with a silver dome.

The Rome convent was founded in 1972, in very basic premises in an apartment block. Unfortunately, things went very badly wrong after the superior died in 2009. The new superior was opposed by a faction of two sisters and two priests, who conducted a campaign of persecution which culminated in a physical assault in June 2017. This was reported to the public prosecutor, and hence caused a public scandal.

The convent was suppressed in June 2018. The chapel premises were taken over by Calvinist Protestant worshipping congregation called the "Church of Christ" (''Chiesa di Cristo'').

== Appearance ==
The chapel is a flat-roofed concrete box of no architectural interest.
