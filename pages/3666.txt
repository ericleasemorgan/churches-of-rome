'''Santo Spirito delle Monache Canonichesse '''is a mid 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santi Simone e Giuda Taddeo a Torre Angela]] , and is located at Via di Torrenova 255 in the north of the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Angela Torre Angela].

The dedication is to the Holy Spirit.

== History ==
It is the monastic chapel of a community of Augustinian Canonesses of the Lateran, and is the direct descendent of the lost church of [[Santo Spirito ai Monti]].

The monastery was built in the mid 20th century, on a large plot of land. It is surrounded by gardens.

== Appearance ==
The chapel is part of the convent building, and has no independent identity. 

The monastery has a main wing of three storeys, and a subsidiary wing at each end at right angles. It lacks architectural interest.

Look for an enormous mural of Christ on a blank wall of the convent facing the gateway, with the epigraph ''Io sono via verita e vita. ''There is a little campanile perched on the roof above this, in the form of a square kiosk with a tiled pyramidal cap and a round-headed soundhole on each side.

== Liturgy ==
According to the Diocese (July 2018), public Masses are celebrated at weekdays at 7:45, and on Sundays and Solemnities at 10:00 (8:30 in summer).[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
