'''Immacolata Concezione a Piana del Sole '''is a later 20th century public chapel with its gate at Via Cristoforo Sabbadino 73, which is in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piana_del_Sole Piana del Sole] west of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Galeria Ponte Galeria] and just east of Fiumicino Airport. The chapel faces the Viale di Pescina Gagliarda.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception Immaculate Conception].

== History ==
This chapel is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina].

A Mass centre for this haphazardly developed and messy suburb was provided in the late 20th century. It belongs to the parish of [[Santa Maria Madre della Divina Grazia|Santa Maria Madre della Divina Grazia a Ponte Galeria]], but also functions as a secular meeting place in a locality which lacks social facilities.

== Appearance ==
The chapel is in a large car park, behind a row of olive trees.

This is a high-quality prefabricated building, on a very short rectangular plan which is almost square. The roof is flat, and the walls are in bright white with a row of thin vertical rectangular windows in each.

The entrance has a floating canopy, long and shallow, just below the roofline. On it stands a statue of the Immaculate Conception, also in white. There are two of the windows on the left hand side, and four on the right.

== Liturgy ==
According to the parish website (July 2018), Mass is celebrated:

Weekdays 17:00;

Sundays and Solemnities 9:30, 11:00 (in Polish)'

There is Rosary daily at 16:30, except Sundays when it is at 8:45.
