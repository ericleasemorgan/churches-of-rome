'''Santa Maria dell’Oriente '''is a 20th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santa Maria della Fiducia]], and is located at Via Ollastra Simaxis in the north of the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finocchio_(Roma) Finocchio]. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borghesiana Borghesiana] suburban district.

== Name ==
The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "Our Lady of the East" (the eastern boundary of the city is close). The locality has two names: [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_del_Sole Colle del Sole] or Tavernelle, and the Diocese refers to the chapel on its website as ''Cappella Località Tavernelle. ''However ''Tavernelle ''is, strictly speaking, a very small old hamlet on the Via Prenestina which is now dominated by a garage.

== History ==
The neighbourhood arose from illegally sub-divided farmland which became an unplanned suburb in the Sixties. There was a lot of this sort of thing in the locality at the time. In response, the parish of [[Santa Maria della Fiducia]]  opened several chapels-of-ease of which this is one.

== Appearance ==
The building amounts to a small church, on the plan of a long rectangle of three bays. The fabric is in what looks like cream-coloured concrete blocks, with a shallowly pitched and tiled roof. The side walls have a rectangular window in each of the first two bays, but a small tower campanile adjoins the third bay to the left and a sacristy wing does so to its right.

The roof, which has overhanging eaves, is extended in a cat-slide to cover the sacristy.

The campanile is a concrete frame of three storeys, infilled with grey concrete blocks. The third storey is the bell-chamber, which has a round-headed opening in each face with each opening (a nice touch) having an archivolt of a single layer of red bricks.

The façade is a structural add-on. The church frontage has three doorways, opening from an external loggia. This is created from a row of four thin square concrete piers supporting a horizontal transverse beam, which itself supports a deep frieze and a large gable panel forming a false pediment. The gable panel and loggia framework are coloured to match the walls, but the frieze is in white with a row of well separated little diaper squares. The thin relief edges of the frieze and pediment are in red. The tympanum of the gable contains a hexagonal window, which is actually right at the tip of the roof behind.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated (parish website, June 2018):

Thursdays at 17:00, and Sundays at 10:00.
