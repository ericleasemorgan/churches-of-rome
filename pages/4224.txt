'''Oratorio della Via Crucis nel Foro Romano''' is a lost 18th century Baroque oratory that used to stand just to the right of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Jupiter_Stator_(8th_century_BC) Temple of Romulus] in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum Roman Forum] (this building used to be part of [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]]). It fitted tightly into the gap between that edifice and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Maxentius Basilica of Maxentius]. 

It was built after [[1753]] under Pope [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XIV Benedict XIV] for a confraternity of priests known as the ''Amanti di Gesù e Maria al Monte Calvario ''(Lovers of Jesus and Mary on Mount Calvary). They were responsible for the liturgical and sacramental aspects of celebrations in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum Colosseum], especially the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross Stations of the Cross]. Processions for the latter used to start here. This confraternity was based at the church of [[San Gregorio dei Muratori]].

Despite its small size, this was a lavishly decorated little church with a two-storey Baroque façade flanked by gigantic pilasters and crowned by a projecting triangular pediment. The interior was narrow and rectangular, and proportionally very high.

It was pointlessly demolished in 1877 as part of the "archaeological" nationalist campaign to remove any post-imperial architectural features from the Roman Forum. It was already known that it was sitting on an ancient Roman street, the ''Clivus ad Carinas'', and so there was no genuine archaeological need to remove it. Very few descriptions of the Roman Forum mention its former existence.
