'''San Gaetano dell’Ursuline '''is a mid 20th century convent, school and public chapel at Viale di Trastevere 251, just north of Trastevere train station. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianicolense Gianicolense] quarter.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Cajetan Cajetan].

== History ==
The [http://www.angelamerici.it/news_schede_eng.php?testata=Ursulines%20of%20Mary%20Immaculate%20Virgin%20-%20Gandino&get_id=101 Ursuline Sisters of Mary Immaculate of Gandino] (''Suore Orsoline di Maria Vergine Immacolata di Gandino'') were founded at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandino Gandino] near Bergamo in 1818, and still have their headquarters at the latter place.

They opened a school at the present location in 1932, when the locality was still at the periphery of the city's built up area. The school was destroyed by bombing in 1944 (the bombs were aimed at the nearby railway) and was rebuilt in 1948.

The school chapel has also served as an external Mass centre of the parish of [[Santi Francesco e Caterina, Patroni d’Italia]].

== Exterior ==
The complex is a grimly ugly, rather Soviet-looking set of multi-storey blocks in yellow brick. There is no external sign of a chapel.

== Interior ==
The chapel amounts to a small church on a basilical plan. The decor is in white, but the narrow side aisles are separated by square piers clad in red marble, two on each side. These support galleries, which are joined by a third gallery over the entrance. Interestingly, the solid balustrades of these have cut-outs in the form of Christian symbols.

The floor has a central strip in red marble, matching the piers.

The side aisles do not run the full length of the central nave, leaving a sort of transept before the sanctuary. The latter is rectangular, slightly narrower than the nave and with its walls clad in rough-cut travertine limestone and its floor in red marble.

The former altar against the far wall has been removed, leaving its red marble frame and the tabernacle. Above is a large altarpiece depicting ''The Vision of St Cajetan. ''The saint had a vision of Our Lady in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], during which she handed him the Christ-child, and that is being shown here.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated, according to the Diocese:

Weekdays 7:00;

Sundays and Solemnities 8:00, 10:30.
