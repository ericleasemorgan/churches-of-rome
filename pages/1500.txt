'''All Saints''' (Italian ''Ogni Santi'') is the [[Church of England|Church of England's]] community church in Rome. Pictures of the church at Wikimedia Commons.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:All_Saints_Church_%28Rome%29]

The [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] community in Rome was established in [[1816]] by Rev. Corbet Hue and four English church members. They found a site for a church in [[1880]], and [[George Edmund Street]] built it in the years [[1882]]&ndash;[[1887]]. It's in the Victorian Neo-Gothic style that Street is famous for from several churches in England and the London Law Courts. The organ is from Huddersfield. The spire was added in [[1937]].

While they, of course, serve the resident Anglican Christians, the main task of the community is to provide a centre for Anglican pilgrims visiting Rome. The chaplaincy is part of the Church of England's Diocese of Europe.

It also serves the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] community.
