'''Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore a Mazzalupo '''is a 20th century subsidiary parish church, formerly conventual, at Via Dronero 9 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trionfale_(suburbio_di_Roma) Trionfale suburban district].

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].

== History ==
The church used to be the chapel of the house of studies of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionari_del_Sacro_Cuore_di_Ges%C3%B9 Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus] (''Missionari del Sacro Cuore di Ges''ù) whose main church in Rome is at [[Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore a Piazza Navona]].

The Missionaries took over a pre-existing large three-storey house called the ''Villa Verjus, ''and added a chapel to its right hand side in the mid 20th century. This was given the same dedication as the Piazza Navona shrine church, and was the main Mass centre locally when the area began suburban development.

At the end of the 20th century the house of studies had been closed down, and the premises were being run as a pilgrim hostel (''centro di acconglienza'').

In 2008, the Missionaries gave up the property and it became the parochial offices of the new parish of [[Santa Faustina Kowalska]]. The chapel became one of three Mass centres of the parish, as it awaited a permanent new church (also see [[Santa Maria della Presentazione al Quartaccio]]).

== Appearance ==
The former convent is a rather plain three-storey block of a building, rendered in pale green, on the far side of a rather attractive garden area. The church is attached to the right hand side of this. 

It is a plain rectangular flat-roofed box, also rendered in the same colour. The right hand side wall has two windows with slightly curved tops. A solid parapet in grey cement has been added around the roof, separated from the external walls by a course of tiles.

A wide, open-fronted porch with a slightly gabled roof occupies the entire width of the frontage. Above, the façade is featureless except for a single rectangular window.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated (according to the parish's page on the website below, July 2018):

Weekdays 18:30;

Sundays and Solemnities 8:00, 10:00  (a Mass at 11:30 has been suspended for the summer).
