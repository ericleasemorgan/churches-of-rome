'''Santa Teresa a Monserrato''' was an 18th century convent church located at what is now Via di Monserrato 25, in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regola_(rione_di_Roma) rione Regola].

The dedication was to St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila Teresa of Avila], and also apparently to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her title of Our Lady of Montserrat.

==History==
This tiny church was established after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discalced_Carmelites Discalced Carmelites] moved the administration of their order to the ''Palazzo Ricci ''(then called ''Rocci'') from their former Generalate (headquarters) convent ofÂ [[Santa Teresa e San Giovanni della Croce]]. This occurred in 1759.

It should be noted that this church and the former Generalate church have been seriously confused in some sources.

Brief notices in 19th century guidebooks mention that this was one of the smallest churches in the city. However, it seems to have been regarded as a full church and not as a chapel or oratory.

The Generalate moved again in 1860, to [[Santa Teresa dello Scalone]] and finally to [[Santa Teresa d'Avila]] in 1902. The little church was deconsecrated after [[1870]] and before 1891, when Armellini described it as "demolished". It is not clear whether the present building contains any of the original fabric.
==Appearance==
Apparently the church was a simple rectangular space with one altar, on which was a statue of Our Lady of Montserrat, and had no architectural identity of its own but was part of the convent building.

A watercolour by Achille Pinelli of 1835 survives, and shows a very ornate late Baroque doorcase. The stone frame itself has a Baroque outline more familiar in windows, and above this was an elliptical tondo containing a fresco of St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_the_Cross John of the Cross] in prayer. This was decorated with curlicues, sprays and swags and was crowned by an inwardly curved and molded gable.
