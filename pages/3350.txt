'''Santa Maria della Fiducia '''is a mid 20th century parish church at Via Casilina 1837, in the eastern suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finocchio_(Roma) Finocchio] which is part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borghesiana Borghesiana] suburban district.

The dedication is to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_(Roman_Catholic) Blessed Virgin Mary], under her title of Our Lady of Trust.

== History ==
The church is one of the more basic designs of [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Rossi_(architetto) Tullio Rossi], and was erected in 1940. Back then, Finocchio was a small roadside hamlet centred on a 17th century inn called the ''Osteria del Finocchio. ''However, massive and unregulated suburban development began immediately after the Second World War as migrants displaced by military activity came to settle in Rome.

The parish was set up in 1964. It was put into the care of the ''[http://www.divinoamoreroma.it/oblati.html Oblati Figli della Madonna del Divino Amore]'', who are based at the shrine of the same name -[[Santuario della Madonna del Divino Amore]]. They were joined by the ''[http://www.santuariodivinoamore.it/fmda.html Suore Figlie della Madonna del Divino Amore], ''who established a convent and medical clinic next to the church.

The church has always been regarded as the central focus of the suburb, especially since the ''Osteria ''was illegally demolished in the Sixties. Back then, the suburb suffered from massive illegal subdivision of farmland and the consequent lack of social facilities. There was also much organized crime, but things are better now.

== Appearance ==

=== Layout and fabric ===
The church has a single nave of four bays, and an integral five-sided apsidal sanctuary of the same width. 

The fabric is in brick, with the exterior walls rendered in a cream colour. The nave bays are separated by thin pilasters, and each bay has a round-headed window in each side wall. However, the last two bays have the presbytery and parish offices abutting them on the left hand side.

The main roof is pitched and tiled, and also covers the near two sectors of the apse. The other three sectors have triangular pitches.

There is no proper campanile, but a little gabled bell-cote sits on the presbytery with its right hand side on the far end of the left hand nave side wall. It has a single round-headed opening.

=== Façade ===
The windowless gabled façade has a stone plaque in its centre displaying the coat of arms of Pope [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII Pius XII].

The large open narthex has three entrance arches, with the piers painted brick-orange, and another arch on each side. The tiling on the sloping single-pitched narthex roof contains "AM" in darker tiles, which stands for "Ave Maria". 

The church stands back from the street, and the courtyard in front of it is attractively paved in grey with Marian symbols in white.
