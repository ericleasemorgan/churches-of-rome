'''Santissimo Crocifisso Agonizzante in Arcione''' was a 17th century confraternity oratory, now demolished, in the Via in Arcione in the rione [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevi_(rione_di_Roma) Trevi].

The dedication was to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Cross Holy Cross].
==History==
The Nolli map of 1748 shows this little oratory as just west of [[San Nicola in Arcione]], and as belonging toÂ ''Confraternita del Santissimo Sacramento in Arcione''.

The usual 19th century sources do not seem to mention it, so presumably it did not survive the French occupation at the end of the 18th century.

According to the Italian scholar Ferruccio Lombardi the oratory was destroyed by a fire in 1740. (''Roma: Le chiese scomparse'', p. 117)
==Location==
It was on the north side of Via in Arcione, about where number 107 now is. The rusticated archway there, having an exaggerated keystone with a little ball finial, might have belonged to it.
==Appearance==
The plan was rectangular, with a nave separated from a presbyterium by a triumphal arch.
