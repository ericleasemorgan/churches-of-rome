'''San Giovanni Ventitreesimo (XXIII) a Mezzocammino '''is a 21st century parish church at Via Giuseppe Lucchetti Rossi (s.n.c), to the south of the Grande Raccordo Anulare (Circonvallazione Meridionale) and east of the Via del Mare in the district of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzocammino Mezzocammino].

The dedication is to Pope St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII John XXIII].
==History==
The parish was established in 2006. The first "church" was opened in the following year, and was a little flat-roofed prefabricated hut. Then, in 2009, a much better-quality prefab with a pitched roof was erected next to it, and this is now the main church.

A permanent church is planned for this very new suburb, being developed by the ''Consortio Torrino Mezzocammino''. According to the parish website, a site has been reserved for it on the hill overlooking the present premises.

A 2014 design was published online [https://www.treddi.com/app/gallery/proj/11036-complesso-parrocchiale-san-giovanni-xxiii-mezzocammino-roma here], but nothing is happening as at 2019.
==Appearance==
The large church hut is of concrete slabs and has five bays, with a pitched roof. The parish offices are in a separate wing, also prefabricated, attached to the back. The crappy little flat-roofed "first church" is still there, to the left.

There is nothing of artistic interest here. Wait for the permanent church.

== Liturgy ==
According to the parish website in May 2019, Mass is celebrated:

Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays 19:00; Tuesdays 7:30 and 21:00 (with Lectio Divina); Wednesdays and Fridays  9:00. There is Adoration after the Thursday Mass.

Sundays and Solemnities 9:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 20:00.
