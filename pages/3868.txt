'''Sacro Cuore di Gesù a Prenestino''' was a small early 20th century church in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenestino-Labicano Prenestino-Labicano quarter], just south of the Via Prenestina on the south-west corner of the crossing of Via del Conte di Carmagnola with Via Muzio Attendolo. It has been demolished.

The dedication was to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart Sacred Heart].

This is a very obscure lost church of Rome, but features in maps (including the latest Michelin city map!) and in an old photo on the external link. 

It was neo-Romanesque in style, with a square campanile having a pyramidal cap to the left of the façade. It was apparently a gym after being deconsecrated, but is now gone. 

Just to the west is a convent and school of the ''Sorelle della Misericordia'', known as the ''Casa Sacro Cuore'', and this has its own private chapel.
