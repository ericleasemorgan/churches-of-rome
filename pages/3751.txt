'''Santa Teresa del Bambin Gesù al Gianicolo''' is a deconsecrated earlier 20th century convent church in Via di San Francesco di Sales 61, hidden away on the lower slopes of the Janiculum to the west of Via della Lungara in the north of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastevere Trastevere]. Pictures of the church at Wikimedia Commons are [[commons:Category:Santa_Teresa_del_Bambin_Gesù_in_Trastevere|here]].

The dedication was to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_of_Lisieux St Teresa of the Child Jesus].

==History==
Designed by Cesare Brandi, it was completed in 1925 as a mark of devotion to St Teresa, who was canonised in the same year. 

Attached was a new convent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discalced_Carmelites Discalced Carmelite] friars, the heirs of the nuns of the same order who used to be at [[Santa Maria Regina Coeli alla Lungara|Santa Maria Regina Coeli]] adjacent. They had been dispossessed in 1873. 

In 1942 the convent became the Generalate (headquarters) of the order, but was small for the purpose. After the war the friars moved out (the Generalate is now at [[Santa Teresa d'Avila]]) and the complex devolved to the State. It is presently in the possession of the legal department of the Ministry of Defence.

This is claimed to have been the last church edifice built on a new site in the ''Centro Storico'', and if it had been proposed only a few years later it would have been in a suburb. Its tragedy is that its obscure location meant that it never became part of the Roman pilgrimage circuit, as was the intention of its builders.

The Carmelite order has focused devotion to the saint on the newer church of [[Santa Teresa del Bambin Gesù in Panfilo]]. She has not been lucky in Rome, as the parish there was suppressed in 2012.

==Exterior==
The façade has a neo-Classical design of high quality. 

The central doorway has a dedicatory inscription above it, and above that is a triangular pediment supported by volutes. There is a smaller door on either side of the main door to an identical design, and above these is a pair of porthole windows. The church is built on a slope, so the eastern side door is actually taller than the western one in order to maintain symmetry. Above the windows, on a level above the main door’s pediment, are swags in relief. This first storey of the façade has a horizontal architrave, and the storey above it has three arched windows joined by a string course running over the arches. This is crowned by an overhanging cornice. The whitish rendering of the wall is marked by regularly spaced horizontal grooves, giving a striped effect.
==Interior==
The interior is richly decorated with polychrome marble, and focuses on a painting of ''St Teresa Showering Roses'' which is above the altar.[[File:2011_Teresa_a_Bambin_Gesu,_inscription.jpg|thumb|Dedicatory inscription.]]
