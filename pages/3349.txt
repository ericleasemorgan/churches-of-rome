'''Santa Maria della Divina Provvidenza a Testaccio''' is a deconsecrated 19th century convent church at Via Alessandro Volta in the rione Testaccio (the historic rione Ripa).

The dedication was to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her aspect of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Providence Our Lady of Divine Providence].
==History==
The [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figlie_della_Divina_Provvidenza_(Roma) Daughters of Divine Providence] (''Figlie della Divina Provvidenza'') is a locally founded active religious sisterhood, founded by Maria Elena Bettini in 1832 for the purpose of educating poor girls. The foundation was with the help of the Barnabites at [[San Carlo ai Catinari]], near which church the first convent school opened. The new congregation took the name of the famous miraculous icon in that church.

This first convent was transferred to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testaccio Testaccio] when that formerly mostly uninhabited area was being populated by working-class people. The new complex was designed by Antonio Lenti, and finally completed in [[1889]]. It provided a soup kitchen, orphanage and school for girls, and its church was the first in the neighbourhood (the new parish church of [[Santa Maria Liberatrice a Monte Testaccio]] was to follow).

This convent was the mother house of the congregation until the later 20th century, when the Generalate (headquarters) was moved to [[Santa Maria della Divina Provvidenza a Primavalle]]. This became a poor location for a convent, however, and at the end of the century a large new Generalate and school complex was built at Via Matteo Bartoli 255, in a developing suburb. 

The Testacchio complex, which had come to include a small hospital, was closed in 2008. The Diocese no longer lists the church, so it is presumably deconsecrated.
==Appearance==

The church has a plain and rather formulaic two-story neo-Baroque façade. Four Doric pilasters flank the entrance, which has a segmental pediment. Two framed rectangular sunken panels are in between the pairs of pilasters. Above the entablature is a window with a slightly curved top, flanked by a pair of recessed framed blank tondi. A small triangular pediment occupies only the central third of the roofline.
