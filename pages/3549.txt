'''Sant’Elena all’Esquilino '''is a 19th century convent chapel dependent on the parish of [[Sant'Eusebio all'Esquilino]] , and is located at Via Machiavelli 24 off the Via Merulana.

==Exterior==
It was designed by Ettore Genuini, and was completed in a French Gothic style in 1899 as the convent chapel of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_Missionaries_of_Mary Franciscan Missionaries of Mary]. 

The exterior of the convent looks rather like an attempt at a Venetian town house, rendered in pinkish-grey. There are four storeys, with the entrance through a Gothic archway on the right hand side. The windows are Gothic lancets, in triplets or singly, except for the fourth storey which has a row of seven behind a pilaster colonnade. The entrance archway has an inscription dedicating the building in honour of St Helen, and above there is a pictorial tiled panel depicting the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.
==Interior==
The interior is a small but tall and vaulted single nave, with stained-glass windows and a little circular apse framed by a Gothic archway. The apse itself has six round pilasters with capitals, supporting a sketchy attempt at vaulting in the conch, and there is a fresco of St Helen between the central pair. The archway bears a Latin inscription in Gothic script: ''Et verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis''. This is a quotation from the prologue of the Gospel of St John, and translates “And the Word was made flesh, and lived among us”.
