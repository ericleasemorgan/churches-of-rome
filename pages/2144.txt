The strange appellation, St Stephen of the Croo Monkey, comes from a statue found nearby, depicting an Egyption deity with the head of a croo monkey. In Italian, it is called a macaco, and cacco is a corruption of this word.

==History==

The church was built in the early Middle Ages, probably by Pope [[Honorius I]] c. [[630]].

It was rebuilt in the 12th century, when the [[apse]] and bell-tower were added.

The Sylvestrine monks were granted the church in [[1563]], and still serve it. They renovated it in [[1607]].

The cult of the Holy Name of Mary was introduced here in [[1685]], after the feast of the same name had been introduced by Pope [[Innocent XI]] after a victory over the Turks at Vienna in [[1683]].

==Interior==

Twelve columns from a temple of Isis (from which the statue mentioned above probably came) have been reused in the church.
