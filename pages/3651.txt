The dedication is to Blessed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Giorgio_Frassati Pier Giorgio Frassati], who was a holy engineer at Turin University and who died in 1925.

According to the Diocese (July 2018), Mass is celebrated here at 11:30 on Sundays and Solemnities, but in winter only. The chapel is closed down in summer.
