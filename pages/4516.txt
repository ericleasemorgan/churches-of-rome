'''Santissimo Sacramento e Caterina da Siena''' was a late 17th century (?) oratory on a site now occupied by Via della Lupa 10-11, in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_Marzio rione Campo Marzio].

The dedication was to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Sacrament Blessed Sacrament] and St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Siena Catherine of Siena].

== History ==
The index of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Nolli#Nolli_Map Nolli map] of 1748 indicates that the oratory was occupied by a lay confraternity of the same name, attached to the nearby church of [[San Nicola dei Prefetti]]. Back then this church was being administered by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order Dominicans] of [[Santa Sabina]], and this explains the dedication to a Dominican saint.

It was demolished and replaced with a domestic building later in the century.

== Appearance ==
The Nolli map shows a little oratory on a rectangular plan, divided almost equally into nave and sanctuary by a triumphal arch.
