'''Sant’Andrea Apostolo a Valle Copella '''is a late 20th century parish church at Via del Fosso di Sant’Andrea 108/D, in the suburb of Valle Copella in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casal_Morena Casal Morena] district, east of Ciampino Airport.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_the_Apostle Andrew the Apostle].

This church is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Frascati diocese of Frascati].

The parish is using temporary accommodation while awaiting the construction of a new permanent church. This consists of former restaurant premises in a two-storey building, and is of no interest. Details of liturgical activity are hard to come by.
