'''Sant’Orsola della Pietà '''is a lost church that used to stand at what is now the west end of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, at the approach to the bridge of the same name.

<p style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;">The church is mentioned in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilia_Urbis_Romae Mirabilia Urbis Romae], a 12th century pilgrims' guide, where it is said to be located in what used to be the secretariat of Nero. This does not make much sense, but excavations have revealed remains of what it thought to theS''chola quindecimvirum sacris faciundis'', the offices of the pagan priesthood responsible for certain games (''ludi saeculares'').</p>

<p style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;">The church is listed in the Catalogue of Turin (c. 1320) as having 3 black monks (''habens tres monachos nigros''). Most likely this refers to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine Benedictines], although [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servite_Order Servite] friars are another possibility.</p>

<p style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;">In a bull from Pope [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_III Urban III] in [http://romanchurches.wikia.com/index.php?title=1186&action=edit&redlink=1 1186], it is called ''S. Urso in Ponto''. In the 15th century, the name was changed to''Santa Ursula'', probably because St Ursus was not well known, and there was a mix-up of the kind that is common to the period. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursus_of_Aosta St Ursus] concerned was probably the Irish missionary who was bishop of Aosta in the 6th century, although another saintly Ursus was bishop of Ravenna at the end of the 4th century. A catalogue from [http://romanchurches.wikia.com/index.php?title=1492&action=edit&redlink=1 1492] listed the church as ''S. Ursi alias Ursulae'', while by [http://romanchurches.wikia.com/wiki/1555 1555] it is simply called ''S Ursulae''.</p>

It was rebuilt in the 16th century, and the reconsecration confirmed it as dedicated to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ursula St Ursula]. It is chiefly remembered as being the first church in Rome at which St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Neri Philip Neri] preached. It was, however, demolished when the Corso and bridge were built in [[1886]].
