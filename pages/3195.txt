'''San Fedele da Sigmaringa '''is a modern parish church at Via Mesula 4 in the Pietralata district, east of the junction of the Via Nomentana with the Circonvallazione Salaria. It is up a cul-de-sac off the street named, and can be difficult to find. It is the first on the right after the junction with the Via di Pietralata.

It is a simple building built in 1973, in the form of a barn with a pitched and trussed roof in red tile and the exterior walls rendered in cream. There is a little campanile on the top left hand corner, with an arched soundhole on each side and a pyramidal cap in red tile. The gabled entrance porch has a circular window above it. Gratifyingly, there is a decent set of devotional statues of saints within to be venerated rather than admired as artworks, including one to the patron who was a Capuchin preacher martyred by Calvinists in Switzerland in 1622.
