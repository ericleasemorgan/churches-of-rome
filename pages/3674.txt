'''Santa Teresa delle Suore Carmelitane Missionarie Teresiane '''is an early 20th century convent and public chapel at Via Vincenzo Monti 31/B. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianicolense Gianicolense] quarter, near the Trastevere train station.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila Teresa of Jesus].

== History ==
The convent here was founded as the Generalate (headquarters) of the Teresian Carmelite Missionary Sisters (''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_carmelitane_missionarie_teresiane Suore Carmelitane Missionarie Teresiane]'') shortly after they received papal approval in 1902. They had been founded on the Spanish island of Minorca  in 1861 by Blessed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Palau Francis Palau y Quer].

It is also also a public dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santi Francesco e Caterina, Patroni d’Italia]]'''. '''

== Appearance ==
The chapel amounts to a small rectangular church in a neo-Baroque style. It is part of the convent edifice, but is under its own pitched and tiled roof and has an architectural identity. 

There is a spectacular neo-Baroque façade in now in pale blue after a recent repainting, with architectural features tricked out in white. This has a pair of gigantic, wide pilasters supporting a triangular pediment, and the central vertical zone of each pilaster is recessed with a white border. At the top of each there is no capital, but an inverted lunette or semi-circular device containing a star. The pediment contains a small round window.

The extremely ornate doorway occupies almost the whole height of the recessed central zone of the façade, and is approached by a tall flight of stairs beginning between two gate pillars bearing imitation gas lamps. The actual doorway is flanked by a pair of blind pilasters each enlivened with five regularly spaced horizontal rectangular blocks, and which support a thin horizontal cornice. Fitted between the lintel and the latter is a blank Baroque tablet. On top of the pilasters, above this first cornice, is a pair of doubletted posts each with a bulls-eye motif, and these support a larger projecting cornice. A pair of thin volutes arranged horizontally is fitted into the gap between the cornices. 

Above the second cornice is the coat-of-arms of the congregation richly decorated with volutes and flower sprays, which is flanked by a pair of flaming torch motifs decorated with tassels. 

A little bell-cote or campanile is over the near right hand side wall, having pairs of volutes above the round-headed aperture instead of a pediment. 

== Liturgy ==

Weekdays 6:30;
