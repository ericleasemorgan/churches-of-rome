'''San Giovanni Nepomuceno Neumann '''is a 21st century parish church at Via Filippo Scalzi 9, which is in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montespaccato Montespaccato] to the south of the crossing of the Via di Boccea with the Grande Raccordo Anulare (Circonvallazione Settentrionale).

The dedication is to St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Neumann John Nepomucene Neumann]. He was a 19th century bishop of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia Philadelphia] in the USA, as well as a [[wikipedia:Congregation_of_the_Most_Holy_Redeemer|Redemptorist]].

== History ==
The parish was set up in 2000, and is administered by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Most_Holy_Redeemer Redemptorists].

At present temporary accommodation is being used for worship, as the permanent church has not been built yet. It is the ground floor of an apartment block. The former shop used to be a dependent chapel of [[Santa Maria Janua Coeli]] dedicated to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_of_Cascia Rita], but the new parish took this over.

The parish offices have to be elsewhere, at Via Suor Maria Agostina 124.

The permanent church has a site reserved for it in the south end of the suburb, to the south-west of the junction between Via Gattinara and Via Albugnano. This is not very near the present place of worship. In 2012 a design competition for it was held, which was won by [http://ec2.it/pasqualiassociati Giuseppe Pasquali]. A web-page illustrating his proposal is [https://divisare.com/projects/272938-giuseppe-pasquali-una-chiesa-a-roma here]. Nothing has happened by 2019. 

''Infame!''

== Appearance ==
The "church" is the ground-floor apartment in a four-storey apartment block apparently built in the Seventies. It has an interesting external wall mural to the left of the entrance, showing the patron saint with Sister Maria Ann Boll Bachmann who was the foundress of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Order_of_Saint_Francis#Sisters_of_St._Francis_of_Philadelphia_.28OSF.29 Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia].

The cramped interior is quite inadequate as a parochial place of worship.

The far wall, behind the altar, is (rather alarmingly) covered with crimson flock wallpaper, on which is hung a crucifix flanked by two icons. That on the right is of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Perpetual_Help Our Lady of Perpetual Succour], to which the parish has a devotion, and that on the left is an interesting one of St John Nepomucene.

== Access ==
According to the parish website, the "church" is open:

Daily 9:00 to 19:00 (start of evening Mass).

== Liturgy ==
According to the parish website (May 2019), Mass is celebrated:
