'''San Francesco di Sales a Via della Visitazione '''is a 20th century church at Via della Visitazione 20 (which street is not known to Google Maps) in the Collatino quarter.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_de_Sales Francis de Sales].
==Listing==

The Diocese lists this church as a ''chiesa annessa, ''and as subsidiary to the parish church of [[San Giovanni Battista in Collatino]], which is off the Via Tiburtina in Portonaccio.

There seems to be confusion elsewhere between this church and the monastic church of [[Madonna di Guadalupe e San Francesco di Sales]], which the Diocese lists as subsidiary to [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]] and which is just to the north.

Interestingly, the parish website does not mention this church at all, either in its Mass schedule or anywhere else.
==Locality==
The locality is a scruffy and only partly developed area of the suburb of Portonaccio, around the Via Galla Placidia, and some of the orginal street layout established in the mid 20th century has been obliterated by industrial development.

The Via della Visitazione used to run from the Via Galla Placidia to the Via dei Cluniacensi, just south of the Visitation convent. However, it is now a dead-end private drive with an entrance next to a builders' merchants known as Foredil 87.
==Church==
If this church is still being used for worship, there is no sign of it online.

It is a simple mid 20th century rectangular building with a gabled roof, hidden up the driveway mentioned. From the main road you can see what looks like a low tower campanile, in brick with a large rectangular soundhole.

Beware of the dogs around here.
