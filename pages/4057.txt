'''Santa Croce a Via Aurelia''' is a small church at Via Aurelia 527, in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelio_(quartiere_di_Roma) Aurelio] quarter. It is now a dependent chapel of [[Nostra Signora de Guadalupe e San Filippo Martire in Via Aurelia]].

It was built in the 20th century, a small rectangular edifice in the neo-Classical style with the façade right on the roadside. It is in red brick with some architectural details in stone. The façade has four half-round brick Doric columns supporting an entablature and triangular pediment, and affixed to the pediment is a large rectangular tablet bearing the inscription ''Ad majorem Dei gloriam ''(to the greater glory of God). The entrance has a marble doorcase with a projecting cornice over the lintel, supported by a pair of volute corbels. Over this cornice is an odd blank tablet shaped like a rectangle with a square taken out of each upper corner, giving a stepped effect.

The church has been in bad repair, but is being restored.
