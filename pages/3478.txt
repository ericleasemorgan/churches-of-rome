'''Santi Martiri Coreani '''is a late 20th century collegiate and national church at Via degli Aldobrandeschi 124, in the west of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianicolense_(suburbio_di_Roma) Gianicolense suburban] district.

The dedication is to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Martyrs Martyrs of Korea].
==Status==

This is the Korean national church in Rome, and is attached to the Pontifical Korean College.
==History==

The church was completed with the college in 2002.
==Appearance==

This is a low octagonal building, with the corners of the octagon chamfered (strictly speaking, this makes it an irregular hexadecagon). 

Each long side features a blank wall in pink brick, with <span style="font-size:14px;">a strip of horizontal rectangular windows under the roofline and above a white cornice. Each chamfered corner features either a large rectangular window, or an entrance door in the same clear glass. These are flanked by a pair of pilaster buttresses in the same style as the walls.</span>

The roof has a very slight slope, and is in eight sectors roofed in red composite which meet at a conical glass skylight.

The interior is apparently very simply decorated, and is all in white.
==Access==
The college is south of the Via Aurelia, and next to the Aurelia train station. Bus number 892 from the Baldo degli Ubaldi metro station on the Linea A stop here also.
==Liturgy==
Mass is celebrated on Sundays at 10:30, according to "Baobab" (July 2018).
