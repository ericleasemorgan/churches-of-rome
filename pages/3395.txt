'''Santa Maria Immacolata a Via Laurentina '''is a 20th century convent church at Via Laurentina 450, at the north-east corner of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR,_Rome EUR] quarter and just north of the Laurentina metro station.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her aspect of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception Immaculate Conception.]
==History==

The church belongs to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventual_Franciscans Conventual Franciscans], who have a ''Conservatorio'' there for their Roman province.

The architect of the complex was Arnaldo Foschini, and it was completed in [[1958]].
==Appearance==

The edifice is in a rather stark, vaguely neo-Romanesque style built in red brick on a long rectangular plan parallel to the road. The roof is pitched shallowly and tiled, and there is a row of large rectangular windows below the eaves having matching geometric stone fenestration. There is a narrow string course connecting the bottoms of these windows. Otherwise, the red brick is undecorated.[[File:2011_Franciscan_conventual_curia.jpg|thumb]]

There is a prominent campanile attached to the roadside frontage with a steep pyramidal cap and large rectangular soundholes also having geometric patterned stone fenestration.

== Liturgy ==
Apparently there is a public Mass on Saturdays at 17:00, in a "Charismatic renewal" style. This is an initiative of one of the friars, and so is liable to change.
