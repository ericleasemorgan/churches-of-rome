It is mentioned for the first time in 1178 in a papal bull, and became a parish church in the 15th century. For some reason it changed its name from Santa Maria de Monticellis to that of the two apostles. It was restored in 1720, but deconsecrated at the beginning of the 20th century. The upper part of the facade was demolished then, but the interior still has two frescoes, one of the Madonna with the two apostles of the 15th century, and the other a 14th century crucifix.
