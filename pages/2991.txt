This is a ruined church in the Piazza Lancellotti, dedicated to the old man who embraced the baby Jesus during his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem.


It is first mentioned in 1017, but fell into ruin in the late Middle Ages. The Lancellotti family restored it in the early 17th century (their palace is nearby). Then, in the middle of the 19th century, the church was entrusted to the Arch-confraternity of Saint Margaret of Cortona, who rededicated it to Santa Margherita. At the end of the 19th century the church was closed, and was abandoned completely after the collapse of the roof in 1929. Only the facade remains, with its distinctive oeil-de-boeuf window.
