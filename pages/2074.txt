Santissime Nome di Maria al Foro Traiano is&nbsp
Most Holy Name of Mary at the Forum of Trajan

89 Foro Traiano

Church dedicated to the Holy Name of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
History

The church was built 1736-1741, next to a tiny church standing on the site of a small 15th century church belonging to the Company of St Bernard. The architect was the Frenchman Antoine Derizet.

The feast of the Holy Name of Mary was introduced by Bl. Pope Innocent XI (1676-1689) victory over the Turks at Vienna in 1683. A cult was instituted in S Stefano del Cacco in 1685 by Giuseppe Bianchi. Soon after, he established the Congregation of the Most Holy Name of Mary, which was formally approved in 1688. In 1694, they moved to S Bernardo a Colonna Traiani, and the next year they realized that there was a need to built a new church. They aquired the adjacent plot, and appointed [[Antonio Dérizet]] SS Nome di Maria. The older church, San Bernardo a Colonna Traiani, was demolished in 1748.

The titular of the church is Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos.
Interior

The interior is elliptical. There are seven small chapels, decorated in polychrone marble.

Special notes

An image of the Blessed Virgin, which was once in the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Laterano, hangs above the high altar in a gloria. The icon was given to the Confraternity of St Bernard at the Column of Trajan about 1430, and transferred here in 1741. Once a year, it is taken in solemn procession from the now destroyed church of San Bernardo to its present place in this church.
