==History==
The chapel is part of a long-established farmstead, the oldest building of which is a fortified tower dating from the 11th century. It is thought that the latter was part of the defensive arrangements of the nearby [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_di_Decima Castel di Decima].

The long-established country estate was bought by Cardinal [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Maria_Torriggiani Ludovico Maria Torriggiani] in 1777, together with Castel di Decima. The cardinal built [[Sant’Andrea Apostolo in Castel di Decima]], and seems to have provided this chapel as well.

The Diocese has no listing for this chapel, so presumably it is deconsecrated.
==Appearance==
It is a simple rectangular building, with a gabled and tiled roof and an ancillary chamber or sacristy under a single-pitched roof attached to the left hand side wall.

There seem to be foundations at the far end, which look like a demolished sanctuary narrower than the surviving nave.

The façade is in weathered grey rendering, patched in places with cement. A pair of simple Doric pilasters at the corners support a triangular pediment. The entrance doorway is large and wide, and has a raised frame. Sitting on the lintel of this is a partly blocked rectangular window in the same sort of frame, which intrudes into the tympanum of the pediment.
