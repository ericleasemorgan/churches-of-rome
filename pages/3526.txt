'''Santâ€™Antonio Maria Pucci '''is a dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santa Maria Addolorata ai Goranni]], and is located in an apartment block at Via Rinaldo Rigola 1, north of the Via Prenestina in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatino Collatino] quarter.

The patron saint, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Maria_Pucci Antonio Maria Pucci], was a holy Servite friar of the 19th century.

The Diocese still lists this as a public chapel, but the parish website does not. It might have closed down by now.
