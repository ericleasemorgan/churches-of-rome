The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her title of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel Our Lady of Mount Carmel].

== History ==
This is the convent chapel of the Generalate (international headquarters) of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary_of_Mercy Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy] (the Mercedarian friars), and was built with the rest of the complex in the 1980â€™s. 

This is a dependent chapel of the parish of [[San Giuseppe all'Aurelio]], but has no public liturgical function.

== Appearance ==
The main nave of the chapel is rectangular, with a pitched roof having zig-zag rooflines on either side caused by the insertion of small gables over the two sets of three windows. The attached apse is on a pentagonal plan, also with a pitched roof higher than the roof of the nave. The four sides facing away from the nave have large stained glass windows under the rooflines.
