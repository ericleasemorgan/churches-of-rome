'''Gesù Adolescente a Via Prenestina '''is a 20th century former parish church at Via Prenestina 468 in the Prenestino-Centocelle district. The entrance is just south of the junction with the Via Giuseppe Lusina.

The dedication is to Jesus Christ as a teenager.
==History==

The parish church was also the chapel of the “Istituto Borgo Ragazzi Don Bosco”, a boys’ school founded here in 1948 and run by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesians_of_Don_Bosco Salesian] order.

The parish was established in 1974, but was suppressed in [[2004]].

The church then became the school chapel only, being served from the parish church of [[Sant’Ireneo a Centocelle]].

The complex is now also home to the CFP Borgo Ragazzi, a vocational training centre.
==Appearance==
The church is part of the complex of buildings on the site. It has no separate architectural identity externally.

This looks like a mid-20th century prefab. It is a T-shaped structure, with a single nave and transept but no structural sanctuary. The interior walls are in creamy white. The nave has round-headed windows separated by red pilasters with trapezoidal "capitals", supporting a grey cornice on which the open wooden rafter roof sits.

There are no artworks of interest.
