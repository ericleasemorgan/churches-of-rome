'''San Luigi Maria Grignion de Montfort''' is a striking modern parish and titular church at Viale dei Monfortani 50 in the north of the suburb of Torrevecchia, which is part of the Primavalle district. It is very near the Monte Mario train station, and is next to the railway.
The saint's name is as given, but the church is usually referred to without the "Mary".

The parish is administered by the Company of Mary (Monfortani).

It was designed by Francesco Romanelli, and completed in 1970. The plan is based on an eight-pointed star with the points truncated, except for the point at the entrance where the roof extends to form a triangular canopy. The dominating roof has a complex shape rather like an upturned flower or a lampshade; four of the sides (including the entrance) are crowned with gables, and the pitches corresponding to these run back to form a Greek cross. However, superimposed on this form is a four-sided pyramid with steep sides and the corners chamfered.

The exterior walls are in red brick, with a row of windows under the eaves of the roof except behind the altar where there is a large stained glass window. The wall on either side of this is not brick, but made up of concrete pilasters.

The two points of the star to left and right, midway to the altar, are separate chapels dedicated to Our Lady and St Joseph.

There is a tall detached campanile, formed of four thin concrete pillars clustered close together but not touching. They are connected by small horizontal beams, and meet at the top. An exposed metal ladder runs up the middle, and below the bell is a square platform through which the pillars penetrate.
