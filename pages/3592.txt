'''Santa Maria Assunta ai Palazzoni '''is (or was) a mid 20th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[San Filippo Neri in Eurosia]] ''', '''and is located at Via Cristoforo Colombo 310 on the south-east edge of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbatella Garbatella]. 

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under the aspect of her Assumption.

The name, "Assumption of the Apartment Blocks", is apt as the chapel is in one of the large blocks lining this trunk road.

Mass was being celebrated on Sundays only, at 9:00, but in June 2018 it seems that this has stopped and there is no external sign of a chapel here now.
