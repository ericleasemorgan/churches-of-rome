Beware of the parish website, where some comedian has put a picture of [[Sant'Alfonso de'Liguori all'Esquilino]] on this chapel's page.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities at 10:00, and on Saturdays and eves of Solemnities at 17:00 (18:00 in summer). The chapel is closed in August.
