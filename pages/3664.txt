'''Santa Serena '''is a later 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[San Romualdo Abate a Monte Migliore]] and is located at the isolated little suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizzanello Schizzanello], which is on the Via Laurentina 15 kilometres from the city.

St Serena is a mythical figure, an alleged Christian wife of the emperor [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian Diocletian].

== Location ==
The straightening of the alignment of the main road here has left a length of the old road to the east, and this is called Via Santa Serena. At its south end is a block containing a supermarket and a bar. The chapel is hidden away behind this, up a little driveway next to the scrap yard offices.

== Appearance ==
This is a completely plain later 20th century hut, with a pitched and tiled roof. It is side-on to the access driveway, and has no fa√ßade. A little campanile or bell-cote is on the north-west corner, and this is visible from the main road if you know where to look.

== Liturgy ==
No information -the parish website is defunct (July 2018).
