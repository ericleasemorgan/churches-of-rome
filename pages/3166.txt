'''Santa Chiara alla Borghesiana''' is a 20th century subsidiary parish church at Via Contessa Entellina 6 (note spelling -not "Intellina") in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finocchio_(borgata_di_Roma) Finocchio], to the east of the city and north of the Via Casilina. This is in the Borghesiana zone.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi Clare of Assisi].
==History==

This is a subsidiary church of the parish of [[San Giovanni Maria Vianney]], built in the late 20th century.
==Appearance==

The building is very basic, little more than a hut with walls in white breeze-blocks and a gabled roof. There is a nave, and a separate sanctuary.

It is hidden away behind a scruffy hedge at the west end of the street, but you can't miss it because it has a prominent open tower campanile over the sanctuary. This is a cylinder made out of vertical steel rods, like a cage, and near the top is an odd fabrication looking like an inverted sink plunger on a horizontal car steering wheel. This in turn supports a large cross at the top of the cylinder.
==Romanian Orthodox==
The church is also used by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Orthodox_Church Romanian Orthodox] parish of St Demetrius the New (''Parohia Sf√¢ntul Dimitrie cel Nou''), which was established in [[2004]]. Non-Orthodox are welcome to attend the liturgies, but should not receive Communion.
