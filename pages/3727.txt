'''Santissimo Sacramento e Lorenzo Martire''' is a deconsecrated Baroque chapel or oratory at Via Belsiana 48/B, just east of the Corso in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_Marzio rione Campo Marzio].

The dedication was to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Sacrament Blessed Sacrament] and St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Rome Lawrence].
==History==

The oratory used to belong to a Eucharistic confraternity, attached to the parish of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]] and founded in 1576. They erected it two years later, together with adjacent premises for their secular activities. It was remodelled, perhaps by Nicola Michetti, in [[1724]].

Towards the end of the 19th century it became a noted venue for concerts of Baroque music while remaining a functioning oratory. However, it was finally deconsecrated in 1970 and is now a shop called ''Gherardini''.
==Appearance==
The plan is of a simple rectangle. Unusually for an oratory, there is a crypt and hence the entrance is approached by a flight of stairs. Round windows on either side of this light the crypt.

The simple fa√ßade has two pairs of rectangular pilasters without capitals, supporting an entablature which has a dedicatory inscription on the frieze and a projecting cornice. There is a roundel in relief between each pair, midway up.

The doorway is surrounded by a thin ribbon string course, and this continues up with a couple of flourishes to run under a low floating archivolt in relief. There is no other decoration.

Apparently, when it was a functioning oratory it contained nothing worth a visit to see - ''non contiene opera d'arte''.
