'''San Massimo Vescovo a Palmarola '''is a later 20th century parish church at Via Giuseppe Boffito 9, in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmarola_(Roma) Palmarola] which is the south part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottavia_(zona_di_Roma) Ottavia] suburban zone. The address is in a cul-de-sac off the Via di Casal del Marmo.

The patron saint, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximus_of_Turin Maximus of Turin], was a 5<sup style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; ">th</sup> century patristic author and bishop of Turin.

== History ==
The parish was established in 1983, as one of three in the locality which have "churches" in apartment blocks. (Also see [[Santa Brigida di Svezia]] and [[Santâ€™Ilario di Poitiers]].)

It has a very poor online presence, and no information on liturgical activities is available.

If a permanent church is built for the locality, this parish is liable to be suppressed in favour of ''Santa Brigida.''

== Appearance ==
The church is in the ground floor of a six-storey red brick apartment block. Look for a cross made of two sticks inserted into a tree stump by the gate.

There is no dedicated car park.
