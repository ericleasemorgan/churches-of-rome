'''Sant'Agostino Vescovo a Stagni di Ostia''' is a 21st century parish church at Via Federico Bazzini s.n.c which is in the suburb of Stagni di Ostia to the south-east of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica Ostia Antica] and part of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica zone] named after the latter.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo Augustine of Hippo].

== History ==
At Via Giuseppe Micali 213 nearby used to be a late 20th century dependent chapel of the parish of [[Sant'Aurea a Ostia Antica]], called the ''Cappella dei Beatudini''. This had an unusual dedication, to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes Beatitudes] uttered by Christ in the Gospel of Matthew. 

However, in 2012 the new parish of ''Sant'Agostino Vescovo''''' '''was founded, and took over the chapel as its temporary place of worship. This is now one of four parishes in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sede_suburbicaria_di_Ostia Suburbican Diocese of Ostia].

The original edifice must have been completely unsuitable, because in the same year the parish replaced it with a large tent or marquee (!).

The original tent had to be replaced with a new one in 2015. After understandable complaints, the Vicariate of Rome arranged in 2016 to provide a temporary structure such as a prefabricated hut.

Tragically, there were problems with the project for a permanent church that arose in 2016. Firstly, an ancient cistern was found on the proposed site which means further archaeological investigation. Secondly, the parish is in a queue for funds to build, and apparently the local parish of [[San Vincenzo de’Paoli a Lido di Ostia|San Vincenzo de’ Paoli a Lido di Ostia]] has priority. Thirdly, and most seriously, the site is a drained marsh containing peat. This has been "spontaneously" combusting, and until this problem is solved the site cannot be built on.

A temporary prefabricated church edifice was finally erected on part of the reserved site of the permanent church in 2017.

== Appearance ==
The church is a simple prefabricated building in a scruffy field at the junction between the Via Giuseppe Micali and the Via Federico Bazzini.

The priest's house and parish centre is at Via Giuseppe Micali 21, to the south of the original chapel site.

== Liturgy ==
The parish website states that Mass is celebrated:

Sundays and Solemnities 18:00 (Saturday), 10:00, 11:00, 18:00.

Tuesday to Friday 18:00.

Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament takes place on Thursdays between 19:45 and 21:45.
