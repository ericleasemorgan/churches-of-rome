'''Santa Rosalia all’Acquafredda '''is a 20th century subsidiary church of the parish of [[San Giuseppe all'Aurelio|San Giuseppe all’Aurelio]], and is at Via di Acquafredda which runs from the suburb of Monte Spaccato into a rural location north-east of the junction between the Via Aurelia and the Circonvallazione Settentrionale. This is in the Aurelio suburban quarter.

There is no street number advertised for it, either by Diocese or parish.

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Rosalia Rosalia], who <span style="font-size:14px;">was a hermit near Palermo in Sicily in the 12th century</span><span style="font-size:14px;">.</span>
==Appearance==
The church edifice is basically a white-walled barn, with a gabled and tiled roof. Look for the cross on the apex of the gable.
==Access==

The church is not in the mediaeval hamlet of Acquafredda, which is much further to the south-west. Rather, it is in an isolated little suburb in the fields some distance south-west of the Battistini metro station. The 906 bus runs through there, connecting with the metro at Cornelia.

The church is the last building on the roadside at the south end of the settlement.
==Liturgy==
Mass is celebrated (parish website, July 2018):

Weekdays 17:00, Sundays 9:00.

(This is apparently such a boring and isolated little building that no other website features it.)
