'''Santi Crisante e Daria''' is a later 20th century parish church with a postal address at Via Castignano 12, just south-west of the junction of the Via Salaria with the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostrada_A90 Grande Raccordo Anulare] (Circonvallazione Settentrionale) in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Giubileo Castel Giubileo] zone.

The patron saints, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Chrysanthus_and_Daria Chrysanthus and Daria], were Roman martyrs buried on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Salaria Via Salaria]. Nothing is known about them, although their unreliable legend describes them as a married couple.

== History ==
The territory of the parish contains the ancient sacred site of [[San Michele Archangelo a Castel Giubileo]].

The parish was set up in 1964, and was initially entrusted to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin Capuchins]. It is now with diocesan clergy.

The church was designed by Aldo Aloysi and Ernesto Vichi, and was completed in 1980. 

== Appearance ==
This is a nondescript edifice on a square plan with white exterior walls and a low flat roof. It is part of a larger edifice including ancillary facilities; a taller priests' house abuts the altar wall, and to the left of the entrance abuts another higher structure with a roof sloping up from left to right. 

The fa√ßade has a horizontal canopy running its length, and a line of rectangular windows below the roofline. The concrete roof girders interrupt this row in two places. 

There are no other windows, but there is a long transverse rectangular skylight over the altar.

== Liturgy ==
The parish seems to have no website.

According to the Diocese, in 2017 Mass was being celebrated:

Weekdays 18:00 (Wednesday 19:00);

Sundays and Solemnities 8:30, 10:30, 11:30.

There is only one priest here, so these times might change -especially as regards having three Sunday Masses.
