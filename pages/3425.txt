'''Santa Maria Madre della Divina Grazia '''is a late 20th century parish church at Largo Domus de Maria 7, in the zone of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Galeria Ponte Galeria]. The address is a piazza on the Via Portuense.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "Mother of Divine Grace".

This church is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the diocese of Porto Santa Rufina. 

== History ==
The old village of Ponte Galeria on the Tiber river, east of Fiumicino, had a little place of worship called the [[Santissima Eucarista a Ponte Galeria|Chiesuola Serlupi]]. However, with suburban development in the later 20th century this became hopelessly inadequate and was replaced by a new parish church in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. The latter is on a more central site in the village, and is part of a sports and social centre. 

== Appearance ==
The church and its ancillary facilities (parish offices and social centre) are united under one enormous low pitched and tiled roof, with the ridge following the major axis of the church. This is to the right of the overall compact structure, which has a transverse rectangular plan and which has the roof sloping uninterruptedly from the church on its left hand side over the ancillary zone mentioned.

The roof includes a lantern over the sanctuary. This lantern has its own little pitched roof, and a window throwing light onto the altar. 

The walls are in pale grey blocks.

The entrance, with a horizontal concrete floating canopy, is under the gable of the roof and between it and the roofline are vertical double rows of very small windows. The rest of the fa√ßade is blank. It is approached by quite a steep stairway, as the church stands on top of a bank some distance from the road.

There is a spectacular detached campanile to the right. There is an enclosed first storey, and from this four concrete piers rise for another three open storeys separated by landing floors (the way up is by steel ladders exposed to view). Above these is the complicated geometric form of the bell-chamber; four separate concrete beams attached to the insides of the main piers rise and are connected at the top as two pairs by struts forming two sides of a triangle. Two other little piers connected at the top in the same way are inserted vertically at right angles.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated (parish website, July 2018):

Weekdays 18:30;

Sundays and Solemnities  8:00, 11:00 and 18:30.

There is Rosary every day at 18:00.

On the first, second and fourth Thursdays of the month there is Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament from 21:00 to 22:00, also on Sundays from 17:30 to 18:30.

There is an external Mass centre at [[Immacolata Concezione a Piana del Sole]].
