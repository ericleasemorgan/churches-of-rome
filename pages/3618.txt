'''Santa Maria Mater Salvatoris dei Salvatoriani '''is a later 20th century convent and public chapel located at Via Filippo Clementi 40, just off the Via Pontina in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallerano_(zona_di_Roma) Vallerano] suburban zone.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of "Mother of the Saviour".

== Status ==
It should be noted that this chapel is being referred to as a "church" (''chiesa'') by the Diocese, although it is not in the dedicated online diocesan lists of Roman churches. 

This was an alteration introduced into the diocesan website in 2012, and seems to have something to do with the changes in the local parish in 2010 (see below).

== History ==
The chapel belongs to the Generalate of the ''Salvatoriani Laici Italiana, ''which is known as the ''Comunità Mater Salvatoris''. 

The complex was built in the last quarter of the 20th century, when the clerical order of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatorians Salvatorians] took over the local parish of ''SS Martino e Antonio Abbate. ''For them was built a parish church of [[Gesù Divin Salvatore]]. The ''Laici ''is a lay confraternity which is counted as part of the Salvatorian religious family.

Unfortunately the Salvatorians left the parish in 2010. As part of an agreement with the diocesan clergy replacing them, the private convent chapel has been made public. Otherwise, Mass might have ceased to be celebrated here.

== Appearance ==
The convent is formed of two three-storey blocks joined together, one having a complex pitched roof and the other a flat one. The chapel is in the latter block, which looks newer.

The Via Filippo Clementi amounts to a dead-end driveway for the convent, which is at its far end. It is actually the ancient route of the Via Pontina, which here has been bypassed by a new section running to the west of the convent. There is a revetting wall here, making the premises difficult to view from the main road.

The chapel has no architectural identity, apart from a small campanile or bell-cote on the parapet of the flat-roofed block.

The sculptor Giuseppe Rogolino has provided a bronze crucifix and a terracotta bas-relief of ''St Joseph and the Christ-Child. ''Apparently he also designed two stained glass windows, one over the entrance and one in the sanctuary.

== Liturgy ==
According to the Diocese (July 2018), Mass is celebrated publicly:

Weekdays 18:00 (19:00 in DST);

Sundays and Solemnities 9:00.
