'''Sant'Elisabetta al Gonfalone '''was an 18th century oratory, now demolished, on the west side of Via dei Banchi Vecchi just north of [[Santa Lucia del Gonfalone]]. This is in the rione [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_(rione_di_Roma) Ponte].The dedication was to "St Elizabeth", presumably St [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary Elizabeth of Hungary] who was famous for her concern for poor people.

==History==
This oratory is shown on the Nolli map of 1748 as belonging to the ''Università dei Mendicanti Invalidi, ''which was a charitable organisation set up to help blind and crippled beggars.

Armellini quotes a reference by the Vatican archivist Michele Lonigo (1572-1638), who stated that a small church or chapel dedicated to SS [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Cosmas_and_Damian Cosmas and Damian] used to stand on the site. The building survived, although deconsecrated and used for business purposes, in his day.

Fioravante Martinelli (1599-1667) noted that it was attached to the chapter of St Peter's, so was already reconsecrated when he wrote this.

Gregorio Terribilini visited in 1748, and noted an epigraph mentioning a restoration by Pope [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sixtus_IV Sixtus IV] (1471-84) of the original church of ''Santi Cosma e Damiano.''

The oratory seems to have been demolished in the late 19th century for the present building.
==Location==
It was located about where number 19 now is, the ''Sancesario Bijoux.''
==Appearance==
It was a simple rectangular space, accessed from the entrance via a tiny square antechamber.
