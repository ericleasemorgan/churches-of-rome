'''San Michele Arcangelo al Flaminio '''is a mid 20th century cemetery church at Via Flaminia 1444, in the angle between the Via Flaminia and the Via Tiberina north of the Circonvallazione Settentrionale. This is in the Prima Porta district. Pictures of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [[commons:Category:San_Michele_Arcangelo_al_Flaminio|here]].

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel) Michael the Archangel].
==History==
The church serves the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimitero_Flaminio Cimitero Flaminio], which is a very large cemetery covering an area of 150 hectares. This is larger than many suburbs of Rome. The cemetery here, with the church, was consecrated in [[1941]].

Although is a subsidiary church in the parish of [[Santi Urbano e Lorenzo a Prima Porta]], the church has had its own priest in the past and counts as a ''Chiesa Rettoria''. However, in recent years the post has been left vacant.

In 1991 a separate Polish Chapel was consecrated for the cemetery.
==Appearance==

The church is a small modernist edifice, on a U-shaped plan with the sides slightly splayed and located on a terrace approached by steps. The blank walls are in pinkish-grey concrete slabs. There are no wall windows, but the roof is raised above a recessed strip of windows which runs round the top of the church. The flat roof has protruding eaves, and a central capsule-shaped lantern. 

There is a flat horizontal entrance canopy supported on two rows of square concrete pillars, which is wider than the church itself. There are six pillars in each row.

A monumental relief sculpture of the ''Ascension of Christ'' is attached to the façade. 

The interior is apparently very simple, in white with a grey marble floor enlivened by two longitudinal stripes in red. 

== Liturgy ==
According to the parish website (July 2018), Mass is celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities (only) at 9:30.

==Access==
There are several routes of the city's dedicated cemetery bus service which arrive here. They are: C1 to C7 inclusive. Only the C1 runs on weekdays (Mon-Fri), and this starts at the Montebello train station.

Cemetery opening hours are 7:30 to 18:00, with an extra hour in the evening from April to September.

The church is located in block 6, which is on the Viale del Redentore near the main entrance on the Via Flaminia.

The new Polish chapel is on the Viale Arciconfraternita di Nostra Signora di Lourdes, to the east of the Ossario.
