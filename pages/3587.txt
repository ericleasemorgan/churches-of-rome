'''Madonna delle Azalee '''is (or was) a later 20th century public chapel of the parish of [[San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle]] , and is located at Via delle Azalee 148 in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centocelle Centocelle].

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].

The chapel occupies small shop premises on the ground floor of a very ugly five-storey concrete apartment block. 

The pretty name means "Our Lady of the Azaleas", which gives a false impression of the rather horrible suburban locality (they are only likely to be found growing in pots on apartment balconies).

Mass was celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities at 10:00, until 2018. Then mention of the chapel dropped out of the parish website, and it seems that it is now (August 2018) either shut for summer or closed down.
