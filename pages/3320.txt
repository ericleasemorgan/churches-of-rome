'''Santa Maria dei Pellegrini e Sant’Aristide '''is a 20th century convent church at Via Bernardo Pasquini 34, in the north part of the suburb of Infernetto in the district of Castel Fusano.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristides_of_Athens Aristides]. He was a Christian philosopher who wrote a defence of Christianity and sent it to the emperor [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian Hadrian] in about the year 150.
==History==
This church is part of a convent of the Missionary Sisters of the Holy Family (''Siostry Misjonarki Swietej Rodziny''), a Polish congregation.

It is not immediately obvious why the Diocese has treated this as a church, instead of listing it as a convent chapel. The reason might be because it has served as a Mass-centre for the locality in the absence of a proper church building (although [[San Tommaso Apostolo ad Infernetto]] was finished in 2013).
==Exterior==
The convent is a mid 20th century block on a rectangular plan. The church occupies the part nearest the street, and is a gable-roofed structure with the flat-roofed domestic part of the convent behind.

The edifice is of no interest archtecturally.

The façade and side walls are covered in white tiles up to the rooflines. There is an external loggia with a sloping tiled roof on white concrete columns, and this is continued down both sides of a church as covered walkways to the convent.

The façade loggia has a board below the roofline on which is the dedication of the church. The entrance doors are in glass with a large Maltese cross motif. The corners of the façade have square incisions in the plan, a feature which does not quite reach the gable. Above the loggia are three windows, two large rectangular ones flanking one in the shape of a Latin cross. The gable has a bargeboard in yellow.
==Interior==
There is a short single nave, with walls in large matt cream-coloured tiles with a high pink brick dado. There is a narrower rectangular sanctuary, entered through a portal with a shallowly curved top. The only artworks of interest are the altarpiece on its far wall, which is a modern reditioning of ''The Supper of Emmaus, ''and full-length portraits of Our Lady and St Aristides flanking the sanctuary portal.
==Access==
There is no convenient bus service. The nearest buses are on the Via Cristoforo Colombo, but it is a tiresome walk from there.

Look for a gate in a cypress hedge on the west side of the street, towards its north end.
==Liturgy==
Mass is celebrated (parish website, June 2018):

Weekdays 8:30;

Sundays 12:00.

A <span style="font-size:14px;">community of expatriates from Sri Lanka worships here.</span>

Mass for them is celebrated on Saturdays at 20:00, and on Sundays at 8:30.
