'''Madonna del Buon Consiglio delle Suore Serve di Maria Addolorata '''is a mid 20th century private convent chapel at Via Giacomo Corradi 15 in the suburb of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteverde,_Lazio Monteverde Nuovo]. This is in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianicolense Gianicolense] quarter. 

The chapel was being used as a public Mass centre by the parish of [[Trasfigurazione di Nostro Signore Gesù Cristo]], but this arrangement has ceased.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her aspect of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel Our Lady of Good Counsel].

== History ==
The Servite Sisters of Our Lady of Sorrows (''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_serve_di_Maria_Addolorata_di_Nocera_de%27_Pagani Suore Serve di Maria Addolorata]'') were founded at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocera_Inferiore Nocera Inferiore] by a Neapolitan called Emilia Addatis in 1872. She took the religious name of ''Maria Consiglia dello Spirito Santo''.

The sisters are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiaries tertiaries], part of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servite_Order Servite] religious family, and have been involved in teaching and active charitable works. They are usually distinguished from similarly named congregations by the suffix ''di Nocera de' Pagani ''after the locality of their foundation.

They initially had diocesan approval, but became international in scope and so acquired papal approval in 1951. In the same year the administrative headquarters or Generalate was transferred from Nocera Inferiore to Rome.

In 2018, the Diocese listed Sr Teresa Pastore, the superior general, as the only sister of the congregation resident at Rome. The future of the convent must very dubious.

== Appearance ==
The Generalate occupies a four-storey semi-detached house in brick. The chapel has no distinguishing features, and in fact you can only tell that this is a convent by the plaque on the gatepost.

== Liturgy ==
In 2015, the chapel was not listed by the Diocese as an official public place of worship, but the sisters were allowing the parish of [[Trasfigurazione di Nostro Signore Gesù Cristo]] to use it as a public Mass centre. The saying of private Masses in convent chapels is becoming problematic in the Diocese because of the shortage of priests.

Mass was celebrated on Sundays and Solemnities (only) at 9:30 and 11:00.

However, in 2018 this arrangement has stopped and it is unclear as to whether the chapel is still in use for the celebration of Mass.
