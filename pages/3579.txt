'''Madonna dei Lumi '''is a 20th century public dependent chapel of the parish of [[Santi Simone e Giuda Taddeo a Torre Angela]] , and is located at Via Chirone 27 in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Angela Torre Angela], south of the junction between the Via Prenestina and the Circonvallazione Orientale.

== Name ==
The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under her special title of "Our Lady of Lights" . 
The original shrine of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santuario_della_Madonna_dei_Lumi Madonna dei Lumi] is at the town of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieve_Santo_Stefano Pieve Santo Stefano] near Arezzo.

== Appearance ==
The little chapel is part of a sports and social complex, and is a unit in a larger one-storey building. It has absolutely no architectural interest. Look for a tiny rectangular frontage rendered in dull yellow, on top of a concrete revetment and behind a wire fence. There is a door on the left hand side, a square window to the right and a horizontal tiled canopy stretching the full width. That's it.

== Liturgy ==
According to the DIocese (June 2018), the chapel is now closed in summer.

In winter, Mass is celebrated on Wednesdays at 17:30, and Sundays (and Solemnities) at 10:00.[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
