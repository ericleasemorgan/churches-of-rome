== Location ==
The Diocese has the address down as Via Giovanni Caproni 26, but this must be a mistake because the area is occupied by a factory's open-air storage yard.

The writer has not been able to find this chapel, and presumes that it is in one of the apartment blocks.

== Liturgy ==
Mass is celebrated at 9:00 on Sundays, except in July and August (parish website, June 2018).[[Category:Catholic chapels in larger buildings]]
