'''San Pietro Canisio agli Orti Sallustiani '''is a mid 20th century collegiate church at Via di San Nicola da Tolentino 13 in the rione Trevi, which is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_Germanicum_et_Hungaricum Pontifical German-Hungarian College].

The dedication is to St [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Canisius Peter Canisius], German [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_the_Church Doctor of the Church].

It has no urban presence, and should not be confused with the church of [[San Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani|San Nicola da Tolentino]] which is the other side of the street.

== History==

The college moved to the site in [[1886]] to occupy the then ''Hotel Costanzi'', and built a church in the south-east corner of the city block. This had a dedication to [[San Giovanni Berchmans]], and was an expensive neo-Romanesque edifice with an aisleless nave and large external apse.

Incredibly this was demolished in 1939, after the surrounding area became fully built up and the Via Barberini and Via Leonida Bissolati was constructed. These streets were part of Mussolini's road-building plan for the city, and the latter connected Termini Station with the American Embassy. Unfortunately, the college was in the way. So it was rebuilt in [[1944]], with an interior chapel replacing the former church which was consecrated in 1949.
==Appearance==
There are no architectural features distinct from the edifice of the college, which dates from the 20th century rebuilding but seems to incorporate part of the late 19th century edifice.

Over the entrance from the college courtyard is a statue of St Peter Canisius.

The church has an apse in the form of a segment of a cylinder, and this contains an enormous mosaic in a vaguely Byzantine style which shows Christ enthroned in glory above Our Lady and the apostles.
