'''Immacolata Concezione d'Ivrea''' is  later 20th century private chapel located at Via di Val Cannuta 200 in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelio_(suburbio_di_Roma) Aurelio] suburban district. Pictures of the church on Wikimedia Commons are [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Silvio_Galizia_Ivrea001.JPG here] and [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Silvio_Galizia_Ivrea002.JPG here].

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her attribute of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception Immaculate Conception].

== History ==
The Sisters of Charity of the Immaculate Conception of Ivrea (''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_di_carit%C3%A0_dell%27Immacolata_Concezione_(Ivrea) Suore della Carit√† dell'Immacolata Concezione d'Ivrea]'') was founded at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinerolo Pinerolo] near Turin in 1828, and established the large convent and school of [[Immacolata dei Miracoli]] near the Vatican in 1906. Then they took over the convent of [[Sante Rufina e Seconda in Trastevere|Sante Rufina e Seconda]] in Trastevere in 1917. Back then, that locality was a poor working-class one which was appropriate for the ministrations of the sisters -it is very different now.

A large new convent on a suburban site was began as the congregation's Generalate (headquarters) in 1960, and a chapel added in 1973. The latter is an important work by the modernist architect [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Galizia Silvio Galizia]. 

The project was overly optimistic, although the sudden drop in vocations after the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council Second Vatican Council] was perhaps impossible to predict. At present (2016) the Generalate is at ''Sante Rufina e Seconda, ''and the Aurelio convent is a residential care home for elderly sisters. It is also the noviciate, according to the Diocese.

There seems to be some doubt as to the future of this convent.

== Appearance ==
The plan is almost indescribable, being based vaguely on a logarithmic spiral or nautilus with a central tower and an outer wall with sections inwardly curved. The copper-sheathed roof is in sectors spiralling round the tower, which has a circular bubble skylight.

The building material is shuttered concrete, inside and out.

Unfortunately the chapel stands well away from the street, behind a wall. A glimpse of it can be had through a gate.

A look at Google Earth for the address is recommended.
