'''Sant'Eufemia''' used to stand on the north-east corner of the junction between Via Alessandrina and Foro Traiano, and belonged to a small monastery of sisters whose congregation was named after the saint. A Vasi engraving depicts it, albeit from a distance (it is the church at the end of the street).

It was demolished in 1812 to make way for the archaeological excavation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_Ulpia Basilica Ulpia], the remains of which are visible there now. The sisters also had the convent of [[Santâ€™Urbano ai Pantani|Sant'Urbano ai Pantani]] further south down the Via Alessandrina, which was only demolished in 1930. The two convents have been confused in modern writings.

The patron saint was an early 4<sup>th</sup> century martyr at Chalcedon, which is now in the Asian part of Istanbul in Turkey.

The edifice was a small aisleless rectangular building with a circular apse, at the south-east corner of a long, thin cloister running northwards. This only had covered walkways at the short ends, and part of its western side was occupied by a simple boundary wall dividing it from the convent of [[Santo Spirito ai Monti]] next door.
