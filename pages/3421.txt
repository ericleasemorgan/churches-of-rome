'''Santa Maria di Porcareccia '''is a 17<sup>th</sup> century church at Piazza del Castello di Porcareccia 1, in the north of the zone of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casalotti Casalotti] which is on the Via di Boccea just west of the Grande Raccordo Anulare (Circonvallazione Settentrionale).

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].

This church is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina].

== History ==
The history of the church is linked to that of the little fortified settlement of which it is a part, the ''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_di_Porcareccia Castello di Porcareccia].'' This appears in the historical records in 1002.

The present church was built as part of the complex when the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ospedalieri_di_Santo_Spirito Hospitaller Order of the Holy Spirit] obtained the property in 1693. It served as the church of the district until it proved too small to cope with suburban development, and was replaced in 1954 by [[Santa Gemma Galgani a Casalotti]] close by to the east.

The Giovenale family obtained possession in 1932, and remain the owners. The church is now private, and has no public liturgical function.

== Appearance ==
The ''Castello ''is a compact set of buildings, completely surrounding a triangular courtyard. The little church occupies the middle of the south wing, and has a simple Baroque façade topped by a triangular pediment with a deep tympanum. A pair of blind pilasters at the corners meld with a sub-architrave below the entablature, forming a frame for the façade. 

The single doorway has a molded door-case, above which is a large rectangular window with a Baroque frame in low relief. 

The wooden marquetry altar frontal was crafted by Austrian prisoners of war interned here in the First World War.
