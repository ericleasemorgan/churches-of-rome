'''Santissimo Sacramento e Cinque Piaghe '''is a heavily restored 17th century Baroque church at Via dei Baullari 144, to the east of the Palazzo della Cancelleria in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parione rione Parione]. Pictures of the church at Wikimedia Commons are [[commons:Category:Santissimo_Sacramento_e_Cinque_Piaghe|here]].

The dedication is to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Sacrament Blessed Sacrament] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Wounds Five Wounds] of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
==History==
The church belongs to the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament and the Five Wounds, a Papal foundation attached to the parish of [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]].

In 1617 the confraternity commissioned Giulio Rainaldo to build an oratory for themselves, with an entrance opposite the parish church in Vicolo dell’Aquila. 

In 1863 there was a restoration by Luigi Tedeschi, who reversed the orientation and provided the façade on Via dei Baullari.

The oratory was deconsecrated in the late 20th century as being surplus to requirements, but has been reconsecrated. The priest in charge, Mgr Alessandro De Angelis, is also chairman of the confraternity.

The Diocese regards this as a church, not as an oratory.
==Exterior==
The façade has four Ionic pillars in the round, supporting an entablature and standing on two high plinths either side [[File:2011_Oratorio_Quinque_Piaghe.jpg|thumb]]of the entrance. Above the latter is a dedicatory inscription, then a horizontal cornice topped by a square window.

Above the entablature is a large arched window having doubled square Ionic pilasters supporting the arch, which is topped by a segmental pediment. Two concave curves sweep down from the pediment architrave to a pair of urns on top of two pilasters flanking the first storey.

Above all this the façade continues in a domestic style for another storey to the actual roofline, except that there are four statues of angels in niches up there.
