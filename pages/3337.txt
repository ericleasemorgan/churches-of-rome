'''Santa Maria del Rosario di Pompei alla Magliana''' used to be a modern parish church, until it was replaced by [[Santa Maria del Rosario ai Martiri Portuensi]]. It is at Piazza della Madonna di Pompeii, on the Via Portuense in the suburb of Magliana and near the Magliana train station.

The church now belongs to the Missionary Sisters of St Charles Borromeo. The reference to ''Pompei'' is to a famous Marian shrine near the famous ruined city of Pompeii.

Completed in 1915, it is a small rectangular building with a pitched and tiled roof and exterior walls in square-cut travertine blocks. It is on a corner site, and is unusual in having two entrance façades. The original one is along one side, and features six brick Doric pilasters supporting an entablature below the roofline, with the entablature over the central four pilasters brought slightly forward. There used to be a large triangular pediment over this section, but that has been removed. A pair of round-headed windows are inserted near the outer corners, and the entrance has a triangular pediment.

The present entrance façade, at the end, was completed in the mid 20th century. The design of the side façade is imitated, except that there are four pilasters supporting a triangular pediment. The cornice of the latter is broken by the insertion of a rectangular window, which looks incongrouous but the window was there first.
