'''Madonna di Fatima delle Suore Catechiste del Sacro Cuore '''is a later 20th century private convent chapel at Via Giuseppe Cerbara 40 in the suburb of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Marancia Tor Marancia], east of Garbatella in the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeatino Ardeatino] quarter.

The dedication is to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], under her title of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_F%C3%A1tima Our Lady of Fatima].

== History ==
The Catechist Sisters of the Sacred Heart (''[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suore_catechiste_del_Sacro_Cuore Suore Catechiste del Sacro Cuore]'') were founded at [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casoria Casoria] near Naples in 1905 by St [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulia_Salzano Giulia Salzano]. They received papal approval in 1960, and moved their Generalate (headquarters) to Rome.

The chapel here is dependent on the the parish of [[Nostra Signora di Lourdes a Tor Marancia]].

== Appearance ==
The chapel is part of a high-quality early Sixties convent complex, but unfortunately is rather hidden away from the street as it joins to the back of the main wing. Hence there is no fa√ßade.

The plan is based on a Greek cross, with a central dome and short arms. The near arms abuts the convent, and the far one has an integral semi-circular apse. 

The fabric is in red brick, and the roofs are pitched and tiled including that of the apse which is tiled in a curve. The walls at the ends of the side cross arms each have three tall round-headed windows, and a small chapel is tucked into the corner between the left hand side arm and the sanctuary.

The dome is impressive. The drum is occupied by twelve round-headed windows, and the dome itself is cone-shaped and is in green copper. It has fairly wide eaves, making it look like a witch's hat.
