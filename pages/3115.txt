'''Santissimo Crocifisso al Corso '''is an oratory in the Piazza del’Oratorio near the Corso, in the rione Trevi.

The church of [[San Marcello al Corso]] was completely gutted in a fire in 1519, and the only item to survive unscathed was the wooden crucifix which had been over the main altar. It survival was regarded as miraculous, and as a result the Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix was founded in 1526. This is dedicated to promoting the veneration of the Cross, and has spread worldwide. The chapel was built in 1568 as its headquarters, and as a place where the crucifix could be venerated.

The inscription on the façade commemorates the funding of the chapel by Cardinal Farnese. The interior, a simple hall, was entirely frescoed after its construction by different artists. Notable is Pomerancio’s ''Miracle of the Crucifix''. The flat wooden ceiling is superbly carved and painted with coats of arms.

Since the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the crucifix over the altar has been a copy. The original is at San Marcello.
