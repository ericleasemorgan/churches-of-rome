'''San Martino della Scuola di Fanteria '''is a later 20th century military church, part of the School of Infantry (''Scuola di Fanteria'') at Via Stazione di Cesano 423 in the district of [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesano_(zona_di_Roma) Cesano].

The dedication is to St [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuola_di_fanteria_dell%27Esercito_Italiano Martin of Tours], a patron of infantry.

== History ==
This church is in the municipality of Rome, but belongs to the diocese of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Porto_e_Santa_Rufina Porto Santa Rufina]. However, its administration is in the hands of the [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinariato_militare_per_l%27Italia ''Ordinariato militare per l'Italia'']'' ''which provides chaplaincy services for the Italian armed forces and which has its headquarters at [[Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli]] in Rome.

The parish church of [[San Sebastiano a Cesano]] is close by, but the parochial clergy are not routinely involved here.

The School of Infantry was re-located to its present site in 1945, and later a garage for military vehicles was converted into a church to serve the soldiers and their families stationed here.

== Appearance ==
This is a plain rectangular building, facing the administrative headquarters of the ''Scuola.'' The fa√ßade is of blank pink brick with a roofline forming an arc of a circle. 

Inside, the side windows have good stained glass, and there are mosaics of St George and St Martin over the main altar.

== Access ==
As part of a military institution, there is no public access except by express invitation and this includes attendance at liturgical events.
