A tall entrance porch has an arched interior enclosing a tympanum, and a gabled roof supported by a pair of round Corinthian pilasters. Above this is a statue of Our Lady in a round-headed niche also with two round Corinthian pilasters, and flanked by a pair of tall round-headed windows. Above her is a round window set in a tondo, and flanking the entire façade is a pair of gigantic square Corinthian pilasters. The ornate gabled roofline has a frieze of small arches on corbels under it.
